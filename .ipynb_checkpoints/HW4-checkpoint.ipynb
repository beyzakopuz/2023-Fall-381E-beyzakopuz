      "There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been\r\n",
      "wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning;\r\n",
      "but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early)\r\n",
      "the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain\r\n",
      "so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the\r\n",
      "question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly\r\n",
      "afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight,\r\n",
      "with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of\r\n",
      "Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical\r\n",
      "inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama\r\n",

      "with her darlings about her (for the time neither quarrelling nor\r\n",
      "crying) looked perfectly happy. Me, she had dispensed from joining the\r\n",
      "group; saying, “She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me\r\n",
      "at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover\r\n",
      "by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to\r\n",
      "acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive\r\n",
      "and sprightly manner—something lighter, franker, more natural, as it\r\n",
      "were—she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for\r\n",
      "contented, happy, little children.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does Bessie say I have done?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, I don’t like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is\r\n",
      "something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that\r\n",
      "manner. Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain\r\n",
      "silent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. It\r\n",
      "contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care\r\n",
      "that it should be one stored with pictures. I mounted into the\r\n",
      "window-seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk;\r\n",
      "and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in\r\n",
      "double retirement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left\r\n",
      "were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from\r\n",
      "the drear November day. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of\r\n",
      "my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon. Afar, it\r\n",
      "offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and\r\n",
      "storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a\r\n",
      "long and lamentable blast.\r\n",

      "I returned to my book—Bewick’s History of British Birds: the\r\n",
      "letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet\r\n",
      "there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not\r\n",
      "pass quite as a blank. They were those which treat of the haunts of\r\n",
      "sea-fowl; of “the solitary rocks and promontories” by them only\r\n",
      "inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern\r\n",
      "extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,\r\n",
      "Boils round the naked, melancholy isles\r\n",
      "Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge\r\n",
      "Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.”\r\n",

      "accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above\r\n",
      "heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of\r\n",
      "extreme cold.” Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own:\r\n",
      "shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through\r\n",
      "children’s brains, but strangely impressive. The words in these\r\n",
      "introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes,\r\n",
      "and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow\r\n",
      "and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold\r\n",

      "I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard,\r\n",
      "with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon,\r\n",
      "girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the\r\n",
      "hour of eventide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine\r\n",
      "phantoms.\r\n",

      "The fiend pinning down the thief’s pack behind him, I passed over\r\n",
      "quickly: it was an object of terror.\r\n",

      "Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped\r\n",
      "understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting:\r\n",
      "as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter\r\n",
      "evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having\r\n",
      "brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit\r\n",
      "about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed’s lace frills, and crimped her\r\n",
      "nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and\r\n",
      "adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a\r\n",
      "later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of\r\n",
      "Moreland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way. I\r\n",

      "breakfast-room door opened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Boh! Madam Mope!” cried the voice of John Reed; then he paused: he\r\n",
      "found the room apparently empty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where the dickens is she!” he continued. “Lizzy! Georgy! (calling to\r\n",

      "rain—bad animal!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is well I drew the curtain,” thought I; and I wished fervently he\r\n",
      "might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it\r\n",
      "out himself; he was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza\r\n",
      "just put her head in at the door, and said at once—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged\r\n",
      "forth by the said Jack.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” I asked, with awkward diffidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say, ‘What do you want, Master Reed?’” was the answer. “I want you to\r\n",
      "come here;” and seating himself in an arm-chair, he intimated by a\r\n",
      "gesture that I was to approach and stand before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than\r\n",
      "I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his age, with a dingy and\r\n",
      "unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs\r\n",
      "and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at table, which\r\n",
      "made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.\r\n",
      "He ought now to have been at school; but his mama had taken him home\r\n",
      "for a month or two, “on account of his delicate health.” Mr. Miles, the\r\n",
      "master, affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and\r\n",
      "sweetmeats sent him from home; but the mother’s heart turned from an\r\n",
      "opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that\r\n",
      "John’s sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining\r\n",
      "after home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John had not much affection for his mother and sisters, and an\r\n",
      "antipathy to me. He bullied and punished me; not two or three times in\r\n",
      "the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I\r\n",
      "had feared him, and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he\r\n",
      "came near. There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he\r\n",
      "inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces\r\n",
      "or his inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young\r\n",
      "master by taking my part against him, and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf\r\n",
      "on the subject: she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me, though\r\n",
      "he did both now and then in her very presence, more frequently,\r\n",
      "however, behind her back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his chair: he spent some\r\n",
      "three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could\r\n",
      "without damaging the roots: I knew he would soon strike, and while\r\n",
      "dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him\r\n",
      "who would presently deal it. I wonder if he read that notion in my\r\n",
      "face; for, all at once, without speaking, he struck suddenly and\r\n",
      "strongly. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a\r\n",
      "step or two from his chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,” said he,\r\n",
      "“and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look\r\n",
      "you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accustomed to John Reed’s abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it;\r\n",
      "my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the\r\n",
      "insult.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What were you doing behind the curtain?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was reading.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Show the book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I returned to the window and fetched it thence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama\r\n",
      "says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg,\r\n",
      "and not to live here with gentlemen’s children like us, and eat the\r\n",
      "same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama’s expense. Now, I’ll\r\n",
      "teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house\r\n",
      "belongs to me, or will do in a few years. Go and stand by the door, out\r\n",
      "of the way of the mirror and the windows.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so, not at first aware what was his intention; but when I saw him\r\n",
      "lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively\r\n",
      "started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume\r\n",
      "was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and\r\n",
      "cutting it. The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its\r\n",
      "climax; other feelings succeeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wicked and cruel boy!” I said. “You are like a murderer—you are like a\r\n",
      "slave-driver—you are like the Roman emperors!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had read Goldsmith’s History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of\r\n",
      "Nero, Caligula, &c. Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I\r\n",
      "never thought thus to have declared aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! what!” he cried. “Did she say that to me? Did you hear her,\r\n",
      "Eliza and Georgiana? Won’t I tell mama? but first—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ran headlong at me: I felt him grasp my hair and my shoulder: he had\r\n",
      "closed with a desperate thing. I really saw in him a tyrant, a\r\n",
      "murderer. I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my\r\n",
      "neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations\r\n",
      "for the time predominated over fear, and I received him in frantic\r\n",
      "sort. I don’t very well know what I did with my hands, but he called me\r\n",
      "“Rat! Rat!” and bellowed out aloud. Aid was near him: Eliza and\r\n",
      "Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she now came\r\n",
      "upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her maid Abbot. We were parted:\r\n",
      "I heard the words—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Mrs. Reed subjoined—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.” Four hands were\r\n",
      "immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER II\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which\r\n",
      "greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were\r\n",
      "disposed to entertain of me. The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself;\r\n",
      "or rather _out_ of myself, as the French would say: I was conscious\r\n",
      "that a moment’s mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange\r\n",
      "penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my\r\n",
      "desperation, to go all lengths.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she’s like a mad cat.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For shame! for shame!” cried the lady’s-maid. “What shocking conduct,\r\n",
      "Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress’s son! Your\r\n",
      "young master.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Master! How is he my master? Am I a servant?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.\r\n",
      "There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed,\r\n",
      "and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a\r\n",
      "spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you don’t sit still, you must be tied down,” said Bessie. “Miss\r\n",
      "Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature. This\r\n",
      "preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a\r\n",
      "little of the excitement out of me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t take them off,” I cried; “I will not stir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mind you don’t,” said Bessie; and when she had ascertained that I was\r\n",
      "really subsiding, she loosened her hold of me; then she and Miss Abbot\r\n",
      "stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as\r\n",
      "incredulous of my sanity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She never did so before,” at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it was always in her,” was the reply. “I’ve told Missis often my\r\n",
      "opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me. She’s an underhand\r\n",
      "little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go\r\n",
      "to the poorhouse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very\r\n",
      "first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind. This\r\n",
      "reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very\r\n",
      "painful and crushing, but only half intelligible. Miss Abbot joined in—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses\r\n",
      "Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up\r\n",
      "with them. They will have a great deal of money, and you will have\r\n",
      "none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself\r\n",
      "agreeable to them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What we tell you is for your good,” added Bessie, in no harsh voice,\r\n",
      "“you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would\r\n",
      "have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will\r\n",
      "send you away, I am sure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Besides,” said Miss Abbot, “God will punish her: He might strike her\r\n",
      "dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go? Come,\r\n",
      "Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn’t have her heart for anything. Say\r\n",
      "your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don’t\r\n",
      "repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and\r\n",
      "fetch you away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say\r\n",
      "never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead\r\n",
      "Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it\r\n",
      "contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the\r\n",
      "mansion. A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with\r\n",
      "curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre;\r\n",
      "the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half\r\n",
      "shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red;\r\n",
      "the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the\r\n",
      "walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe,\r\n",
      "the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany. Out\r\n",
      "of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the\r\n",
      "piled-up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy\r\n",
      "Marseilles counterpane. Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned\r\n",
      "easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool\r\n",
      "before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent,\r\n",
      "because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was\r\n",
      "known to be so seldom entered. The house-maid alone came here on\r\n",
      "Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week’s quiet\r\n",
      "dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the\r\n",
      "contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored\r\n",
      "divers parchments, her jewel-casket, and a miniature of her deceased\r\n",
      "husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room—the\r\n",
      "spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he breathed\r\n",
      "his last; here he lay in state; hence his coffin was borne by the\r\n",
      "undertaker’s men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration\r\n",
      "had guarded it from frequent intrusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted,\r\n",
      "was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before\r\n",
      "me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued,\r\n",
      "broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the\r\n",
      "muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant\r\n",
      "majesty of the bed and room. I was not quite sure whether they had\r\n",
      "locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see. Alas!\r\n",
      "yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the\r\n",
      "looking-glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it\r\n",
      "revealed. All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in\r\n",
      "reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white\r\n",
      "face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving\r\n",
      "where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it\r\n",
      "like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy, half imp, Bessie’s evening\r\n",
      "stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and\r\n",
      "appearing before the eyes of belated travellers. I returned to my\r\n",
      "stool.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her hour\r\n",
      "for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted\r\n",
      "slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a\r\n",
      "rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal\r\n",
      "present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All John Reed’s violent tyrannies, all his sisters’ proud indifference,\r\n",
      "all his mother’s aversion, all the servants’ partiality, turned up in\r\n",
      "my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well. Why was I\r\n",
      "always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever\r\n",
      "condemned? Why could I never please? Why was it useless to try to win\r\n",
      "any one’s favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected.\r\n",
      "Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and\r\n",
      "insolent carriage, was universally indulged. Her beauty, her pink\r\n",
      "cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at\r\n",
      "her, and to purchase indemnity for every fault. John no one thwarted,\r\n",
      "much less punished; though he twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed\r\n",
      "the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse\r\n",
      "vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the\r\n",

      "still “her own darling.” I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil\r\n",

      "sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to\r\n",
      "them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing,\r\n",
      "incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a\r\n",
      "noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment,\r\n",

      "still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind\r\n",
      "howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a\r\n",
      "stone, and then my courage sank. My habitual mood of humiliation,\r\n",

      "required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she would rear and maintain me as\r\n",
      "one of her own children. Mrs. Reed probably considered she had kept\r\n",
      "this promise; and so she had, I dare say, as well as her nature would\r\n",
      "permit her; but how could she really like an interloper not of her\r\n",
      "race, and unconnected with her, after her husband’s death, by any tie?\r\n",
      "It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung\r\n",
      "pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she could\r\n",

      "recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the\r\n",
      "violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the\r\n",
      "perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed’s spirit,\r\n",

      "preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed\r\n",
      "face, bending over me with strange pity. This idea, consolatory in\r\n",
      "theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I\r\n",
      "endeavoured to stifle it—I endeavoured to be firm. Shaking my hair from\r\n",
      "my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room;\r\n",
      "at this moment a light gleamed on the wall. Was it, I asked myself, a\r\n",
      "ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind? No; moonlight\r\n",
      "was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling\r\n",
      "and quivered over my head. I can now conjecture readily that this\r\n",
      "streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried\r\n",
      "by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for\r\n",
      "horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift\r\n",
      "darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world. My\r\n",
      "heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I\r\n",
      "deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed,\r\n",
      "suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the\r\n",
      "lock in desperate effort. Steps came running along the outer passage;\r\n",
      "the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.” I had now got\r\n",
      "hold of Bessie’s hand, and she did not snatch it from me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She has screamed out on purpose,” declared Abbot, in some disgust.\r\n",
      "“And what a scream! If she had been in great pain one would have\r\n",
      "excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her\r\n",
      "naughty tricks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "came along the corridor, her cap flying wide, her gown rustling\r\n",
      "stormily. “Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre\r\n",

      "cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured. I abhor\r\n",
      "artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Silence! This violence is all most repulsive:” and so, no doubt, she\r\n",

      "The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had\r\n",
      "a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare,\r\n",
      "crossed with thick black bars. I heard voices, too, speaking with a\r\n",
      "hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation,\r\n",
      "uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my\r\n",
      "faculties. Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me;\r\n",
      "lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more\r\n",
      "tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before. I rested my head\r\n",
      "against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite\r\n",
      "well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery\r\n",
      "fire. It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the\r\n",
      "bed-foot with a basin in her hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near\r\n",
      "my pillow, leaning over me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and\r\n",
      "security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an\r\n",
      "individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.\r\n",
      "Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me\r\n",
      "than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the\r\n",
      "face of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,\r\n",
      "sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for\r\n",
      "herself and the children she employed a physician.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, who am I?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pronounced his name, offering him at the same time my hand: he took\r\n",
      "it, smiling and saying, “We shall do very well by-and-by.” Then he laid\r\n",
      "me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her to be very careful that I\r\n",
      "was not disturbed during the night. Having given some further\r\n",
      "directions, and intimated that he should call again the next day, he\r\n",
      "departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he sat\r\n",
      "in the chair near my pillow; and as he closed the door after him, all\r\n",
      "the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness\r\n",
      "weighed it down.\r\n",

      "softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scarcely dared I answer her; for I feared the next sentence might be\r\n",
      "rough. “I will try.”\r\n",

      "“Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren’t for my life be\r\n",
      "alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it’s such a strange\r\n",
      "thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything. Missis\r\n",
      "was rather too hard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sarah came back with her; they both went to bed; they were whispering\r\n",
      "together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep. I caught scraps of\r\n",

      "the main subject discussed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished”—“A great\r\n",

      "the churchyard just over his grave,” &c., &c.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. For me, the\r\n",
      "watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; ear, eye, and\r\n",
      "mind were alike strained by dread: such dread as children only can\r\n",
      "feel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the\r\n",
      "red-room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the\r\n",
      "reverberation to this day. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you I owe some fearful\r\n",
      "pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not\r\n",
      "what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only\r\n",
      "uprooting my bad propensities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by\r\n",
      "the nursery hearth. I felt physically weak and broken down: but my\r\n",
      "worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness\r\n",
      "which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt\r\n",
      "drop from my cheek than another followed. Yet, I thought, I ought to\r\n",
      "have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone\r\n",
      "out in the carriage with their mama. Abbot, too, was sewing in another\r\n",
      "room, and Bessie, as she moved hither and thither, putting away toys\r\n",
      "and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of\r\n",
      "unwonted kindness. This state of things should have been to me a\r\n",
      "paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand\r\n",
      "and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such\r\n",
      "a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them\r\n",
      "agreeably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she brought up with her a\r\n",
      "tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise,\r\n",
      "nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir\r\n",
      "in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had\r\n",
      "often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine\r\n",
      "it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a\r\n",
      "privilege. This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was\r\n",
      "cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it. Vain\r\n",
      "favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished\r\n",
      "for, too late! I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird,\r\n",
      "the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and\r\n",
      "tart away. Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word _book_ acted\r\n",
      "as a transient stimulus, and I begged her to fetch Gulliver’s Travels\r\n",
      "from the library. This book I had again and again perused with delight.\r\n",
      "I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of\r\n",
      "interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves,\r\n",
      "having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under\r\n",
      "mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at\r\n",
      "length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of\r\n",
      "England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker,\r\n",
      "and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being,\r\n",
      "in my creed, solid parts of the earth’s surface, I doubted not that I\r\n",
      "might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little\r\n",
      "fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep,\r\n",
      "and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty\r\n",
      "mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.\r\n",
      "Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand—when I turned\r\n",
      "over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had,\r\n",
      "till now, never failed to find—all was eerie and dreary; the giants\r\n",
      "were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a\r\n",
      "most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions. I closed\r\n",
      "the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table,\r\n",

      "voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, preoccupied with her work, she sang the refrain very low,\r\n",
      "very lingeringly; “A long time ago” came out like the saddest cadence\r\n",

      "“Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what\r\n",
      "about? Have you any pain?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis\r\n",
      "in the carriage,” interposed Bessie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge,\r\n",
      "I answered promptly, “I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate\r\n",
      "going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh fie, Miss!” said Bessie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before\r\n",
      "him; he fixed his eyes on me very steadily: his eyes were small and\r\n",
      "grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now:\r\n",
      "he had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face. Having considered\r\n",
      "me at leisure, he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What made you ill yesterday?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She had a fall,” said Bessie, again putting in her word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can’t she manage to walk at her\r\n",
      "age? She must be eight or nine years old.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was knocked down,” was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by\r\n",
      "another pang of mortified pride; “but that did not make me ill,” I\r\n",
      "added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he was returning the box to his waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang\r\n",
      "for the servants’ dinner; he knew what it was. “That’s for you, nurse,”\r\n",
      "said he; “you can go down; I’ll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come\r\n",
      "back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie would rather have stayed, but she was obliged to go, because\r\n",
      "punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?” pursued Mr. Lloyd when\r\n",
      "Bessie was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ghost! What, you are a baby after all! You are afraid of ghosts?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of Mr. Reed’s ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out\r\n",
      "there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if\r\n",
      "they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a\r\n",
      "candle,—so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in\r\n",
      "daylight?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No: but night will come again before long: and besides,—I am\r\n",
      "unhappy,—very unhappy, for other things.”\r\n",

      "“What other things? Can you tell me some of them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was\r\n",
      "to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their\r\n",
      "feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they\r\n",
      "know not how to express the result of the process in words. Fearful,\r\n",
      "however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my\r\n",
      "grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a\r\n",
      "meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes,\r\n",
      "scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty\r\n",

      "spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore\r\n",
      "backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise:\r\n",
      "John Reed hated his school, and abused his master; but John Reed’s\r\n",
      "tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of\r\n",
      "school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she\r\n",
      "had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her\r\n",
      "details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies\r\n",
      "were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings\r\n",
      "of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing\r\n",
      "and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books\r\n",
      "they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I\r\n",
      "listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long\r\n",
      "journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new\r\n",
      "life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should indeed like to go to school,” was the audible conclusion of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Is that your mistress, nurse?” asked Mr. Lloyd. “I should like to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Bessie invited him to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way\r\n",
      "out. In the interview which followed between him and Mrs. Reed, I\r\n",
      "presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to\r\n",
      "recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt\r\n",
      "readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject\r\n",
      "with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was\r\n",
      "in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, “Missis was, she dared say, glad\r\n",
      "enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always\r\n",
      "looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots\r\n",
      "underhand.” Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of\r\n",
      "infantine Guy Fawkes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot’s\r\n",
      "communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman;\r\n",
      "that my mother had married him against the wishes of her friends, who\r\n",
      "considered the match beneath her; that my grandfather Reed was so\r\n",
      "irritated at her disobedience, he cut her off without a shilling; that\r\n",
      "after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught\r\n",
      "the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing\r\n",
      "town where his curacy was situated, and where that disease was then\r\n",
      "prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him, and both died\r\n",
      "within a month of each other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "is to be pitied, too, Abbot.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” responded Abbot; “if she were a nice, pretty child, one might\r\n",
      "compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a\r\n",
      "little toad as that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a great deal, to be sure,” agreed Bessie: “at any rate, a beauty\r\n",
      "like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!” cried the fervent Abbot. “Little\r\n",
      "darling!—with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour\r\n",
      "as she has; just as if she were painted!—Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh\r\n",
      "rabbit for supper.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported\r\n",
      "conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to\r\n",
      "suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,—I\r\n",
      "desired and waited it in silence. It tarried, however: days and weeks\r\n",
      "passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion\r\n",
      "was made to the subject over which I brooded. Mrs. Reed surveyed me at\r\n",
      "times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she\r\n",
      "had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her\r\n",
      "own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself,\r\n",
      "condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the\r\n",
      "nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room. Not a\r\n",
      "hint, however, did she drop about sending me to school: still I felt an\r\n",
      "instinctive certainty that she would not long endure me under the same\r\n",
      "roof with her; for her glance, now more than ever, when turned on me,\r\n",
      "expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me\r\n",
      "as little as possible: John thrust his tongue in his cheek whenever he\r\n",
      "saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned\r\n",
      "against him, roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate\r\n",
      "revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he thought it better to\r\n",
      "desist, and ran from me uttering execrations, and vowing I had burst\r\n",
      "his nose. I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a\r\n",
      "blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or\r\n",
      "my look daunted him, I had the greatest inclination to follow up my\r\n",
      "advantage to purpose; but he was already with his mama. I heard him in\r\n",
      "a blubbering tone commence the tale of how “that nasty Jane Eyre” had\r\n",
      "flown at him like a mad cat: he was stopped rather harshly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she\r\n",
      "is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your\r\n",
      "sisters should associate with her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at\r\n",
      "all deliberating on my words—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are not fit to associate with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and\r\n",
      "audacious declaration, she ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a\r\n",
      "whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my\r\n",
      "crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter\r\n",
      "one syllable during the remainder of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?” was my scarcely\r\n",
      "voluntary demand. I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my\r\n",
      "tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance:\r\n",
      "something spoke out of me over which I had no control.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” said Mrs. Reed under her breath: her usually cold composed grey\r\n",
      "eye became troubled with a look like fear; she took her hand from my\r\n",
      "arm, and gazed at me as if she really did not know whether I were child\r\n",
      "or fiend. I was now in for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so\r\n",
      "can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how\r\n",
      "you wish me dead.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reed soon rallied her spirits: she shook me most soundly, she\r\n",
      "boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word. Bessie supplied\r\n",
      "the hiatus by a homily of an hour’s length, in which she proved beyond\r\n",
      "a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared\r\n",
      "under a roof. I half believed her; for I felt indeed only bad feelings\r\n",
      "surging in my breast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "November, December, and half of January passed away. Christmas and the\r\n",
      "New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer;\r\n",
      "presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given. From\r\n",
      "every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety\r\n",
      "consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana,\r\n",
      "and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin\r\n",
      "frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and\r\n",
      "afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played\r\n",
      "below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the\r\n",
      "jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken\r\n",
      "hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed. When\r\n",
      "tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the\r\n",
      "solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not\r\n",
      "miserable. To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company,\r\n",
      "for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been\r\n",
      "kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the\r\n",
      "evenings quietly with her, instead of passing them under the formidable\r\n",
      "eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen. But Bessie,\r\n",
      "as soon as she had dressed her young ladies, used to take herself off\r\n",
      "to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper’s room, generally\r\n",
      "bearing the candle along with her. I then sat with my doll on my knee\r\n",
      "till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that\r\n",
      "nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers\r\n",
      "sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings\r\n",
      "as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.\r\n",
      "To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something,\r\n",
      "and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to\r\n",
      "find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby\r\n",
      "as a miniature scarecrow. It puzzles me now to remember with what\r\n",
      "absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive\r\n",
      "and capable of sensation. I could not sleep unless it was folded in my\r\n",
      "night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively\r\n",
      "happy, believing it to be happy likewise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company,\r\n",
      "and listened for the sound of Bessie’s step on the stairs: sometimes\r\n",
      "she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors,\r\n",
      "or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper—a bun or a\r\n",
      "cheese-cake—then she would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I\r\n",
      "had finished, she would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she kissed\r\n",
      "me, and said, “Good night, Miss Jane.” When thus gentle, Bessie seemed\r\n",
      "to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished\r\n",
      "most intensely that she would always be so pleasant and amiable, and\r\n",
      "never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she was too\r\n",
      "often wont to do. Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good\r\n",
      "natural capacity, for she was smart in all she did, and had a\r\n",
      "remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the\r\n",
      "impression made on me by her nursery tales. She was pretty too, if my\r\n",
      "recollections of her face and person are correct. I remember her as a\r\n",
      "slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and\r\n",
      "good, clear complexion; but she had a capricious and hasty temper, and\r\n",
      "indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she was, I\r\n",
      "preferred her to any one else at Gateshead Hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o’clock in the morning:\r\n",
      "Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned\r\n",
      "to their mama; Eliza was putting on her bonnet and warm garden-coat to\r\n",
      "go and feed her poultry, an occupation of which she was fond: and not\r\n",
      "less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the\r\n",
      "money she thus obtained. She had a turn for traffic, and a marked\r\n",
      "propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and\r\n",
      "chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about\r\n",
      "flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having\r\n",
      "orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his young lady all the products of her\r\n",
      "parterre she wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her\r\n",
      "head if she could have made a handsome profit thereby. As to her money,\r\n",
      "she first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old\r\n",
      "curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the\r\n",
      "housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her valued treasure,\r\n",
      "consented to intrust it to her mother, at a usurious rate of\r\n",
      "interest—fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she exacted every\r\n",
      "quarter, keeping her accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.\r\n",

      "which she had found a store in a drawer in the attic. I was making my\r\n",

      "(for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her\r\n",

      "the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a\r\n",
      "carriage roll through. I watched it ascending the drive with\r\n",
      "indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought\r\n",
      "visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house,\r\n",

      "inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands\r\n",
      "with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a\r\n",

      "days! I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to\r\n",

      "ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I _must_ enter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "curtseying low, I looked up at—a black pillar!—such, at least, appeared\r\n",
      "to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing\r\n",
      "erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask,\r\n",
      "placed above the shaft by way of capital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "voice, “Her size is small: what is her age?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ten years.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So much?” was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In uttering these words I looked up: he seemed to me a tall gentleman;\r\n",

      "the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a\r\n",
      "contrary opinion: I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,” he began, “especially a\r\n",
      "naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Not being in a condition to remove his doubt, I only cast my eyes down\r\n",

      "far enough away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Benefactress! benefactress!” said I inwardly: “they all call Mrs. Reed\r\n",

      "and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school,\r\n",
      "I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to\r\n",
      "keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst\r\n",
      "fault, a tendency to deceit. I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that\r\n",
      "you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her\r\n",
      "nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her presence; however\r\n",
      "carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her, my\r\n",
      "efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.\r\n",
      "Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I\r\n",
      "dimly perceived that she was already obliterating hope from the new\r\n",
      "phase of existence which she destined me to enter; I felt, though I\r\n",
      "could not have expressed the feeling, that she was sowing aversion and\r\n",
      "unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr.\r\n",
      "Brocklehurst’s eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do\r\n",
      "to remedy the injury?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, indeed,” thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and\r\n",
      "hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,” said Mr. Brocklehurst; “it\r\n",
      "is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake\r\n",
      "burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed. I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,”\r\n",
      "continued my benefactress; “to be made useful, to be kept humble: as\r\n",
      "for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at\r\n",
      "Lowood.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,” returned Mr.\r\n",
      "Brocklehurst. “Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly\r\n",
      "appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial\r\n",
      "care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them. I have studied\r\n",
      "how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only\r\n",
      "the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success. My second\r\n",
      "daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her\r\n",
      "return she exclaimed: ‘Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls\r\n",
      "at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their\r\n",
      "long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their\r\n",
      "frocks—they are almost like poor people’s children! and,’ said she,\r\n",

      "gown before.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is the state of things I quite approve,” returned Mrs. Reed; “had\r\n",

      "“Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been\r\n",
      "observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of\r\n",
      "Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations,\r\n",
      "hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and\r\n",
      "its inhabitants.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite right, sir. I may then depend upon this child being received as\r\n",
      "a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her\r\n",
      "position and prospects?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants,\r\n",

      "privilege of her election.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I\r\n",
      "assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was\r\n",
      "becoming too irksome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning. I shall\r\n",
      "return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good\r\n",
      "friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner. I shall\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I will, madam. Little girl, here is a book entitled the ‘Child’s\r\n",

      "addicted to falsehood and deceit.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "developed and very solid; her brow was low, her chin large and\r\n",
      "prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her light\r\n",
      "eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her skin was dark and opaque,\r\n",
      "her hair nearly flaxen; her constitution was sound as a bell—illness\r\n",
      "never came near her; she was an exact, clever manager; her household\r\n",
      "and tenantry were thoroughly under her control; her children only at\r\n",
      "times defied her authority and laughed it to scorn; she dressed well,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her arm-chair, I examined her\r\n",

      "pointed as to an appropriate warning. What had just passed; what Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of\r\n",
      "their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had\r\n",

      "resentment fomented now within me.\r\n",

      "at the same time suspended their nimble movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go out of the room; return to the nursery,” was her mandate. My look\r\n",
      "or something else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with\r\n",
      "extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I\r\n",

      "red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in\r\n",
      "agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, ‘Have\r\n",

      "if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into\r\n",
      "unhoped-for liberty. Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed\r\n",
      "looked frightened; her work had slipped from her knee; she was lifting\r\n",
      "up her hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her face as\r\n",
      "if she would cry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you\r\n",
      "tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Mrs. Reed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to\r\n",
      "be your friend.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful\r\n",
      "disposition; and I’ll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and\r\n",
      "what you have done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, you don’t understand these things: children must be corrected\r\n",
      "for their faults.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Deceit is not my fault!” I cried out in a savage, high voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to\r\n",
      "the nursery—there’s a dear—and lie down a little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed, for I hate to live here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will indeed send her to school soon,” murmured Mrs. Reed _sotto\r\n",
      "voce_; and gathering up her work, she abruptly quitted the apartment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was left there alone—winner of the field. It was the hardest battle I\r\n",
      "had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the\r\n",
      "rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror’s\r\n",
      "solitude. First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce\r\n",
      "pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my\r\n",
      "pulses. A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot\r\n",
      "give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine,\r\n",
      "without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of\r\n",
      "reaction. A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would\r\n",
      "have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead,\r\n",
      "would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when\r\n",
      "half-an-hour’s silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my\r\n",
      "conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic\r\n",
      "wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour,\r\n",
      "metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.\r\n",
      "Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed’s pardon; but I\r\n",
      "knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way\r\n",
      "to make her repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every\r\n",
      "turbulent impulse of my nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking;\r\n",
      "fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of\r\n",
      "sombre indignation. I took a book—some Arabian tales; I sat down and\r\n",
      "endeavoured to read. I could make no sense of the subject; my own\r\n",
      "thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found\r\n",
      "fascinating. I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the\r\n",
      "shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or\r\n",
      "breeze, through the grounds. I covered my head and arms with the skirt\r\n",
      "of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was\r\n",
      "quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the\r\n",
      "falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept\r\n",
      "by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together. I leaned against a\r\n",
      "gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where\r\n",
      "the short grass was nipped and blanched. It was a very grey day; a most\r\n",
      "opaque sky, “onding on snaw,” canopied all; thence flakes fell at\r\n",
      "intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without\r\n",
      "melting. I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over\r\n",
      "and over again, “What shall I do?—what shall I do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once I heard a clear voice call, “Miss Jane! where are you? Come\r\n",
      "to lunch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her light step\r\n",
      "came tripping down the path.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You naughty little thing!” she said. “Why don’t you come when you are\r\n",
      "called?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie’s presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been\r\n",
      "brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she was somewhat\r\n",
      "cross. The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed,\r\n",
      "I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid’s transitory anger;\r\n",
      "and I _was_ disposed to bask in her youthful lightness of heart. I just\r\n",
      "put my two arms round her and said, “Come, Bessie! don’t scold.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to\r\n",
      "indulge in: somehow it pleased her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a strange child, Miss Jane,” she said, as she looked down at\r\n",
      "me; “a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I\r\n",
      "suppose?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And won’t you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does Bessie care for me? She is always scolding me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because you’re such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should\r\n",
      "be bolder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! to get more knocks?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that’s certain. My mother said,\r\n",
      "when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one\r\n",
      "of her own to be in your place.—Now, come in, and I’ve some good news\r\n",

      "Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this\r\n",
      "afternoon, and you shall have tea with me. I’ll ask cook to bake you a\r\n",
      "little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for\r\n",
      "I am soon to pack your trunk. Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in\r\n",
      "a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don’t be afraid\r\n",
      "of me. Don’t start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it’s so\r\n",
      "provoking.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I\r\n",

      "dread.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t show it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides”—I was going to say\r\n",
      "something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second\r\n",
      "thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And so you’re glad to leave me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I’m rather sorry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you’d _rather_ not.”\r\n",

      "“I’ll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.” Bessie stooped; we\r\n",
      "mutually embraced, and I followed her into the house quite comforted.\r\n",
      "That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie\r\n",
      "told me some of her most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her\r\n",
      "sweetest songs. Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five o’clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January,\r\n",
      "when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and\r\n",
      "nearly dressed. I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had\r\n",
      "washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just\r\n",
      "setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib. I\r\n",
      "was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates\r\n",
      "at six A.M. Bessie was the only person yet risen; she had lit a fire in\r\n",
      "the nursery, where she now proceeded to make my breakfast. Few children\r\n",
      "can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I.\r\n",
      "Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled\r\n",
      "milk and bread she had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a\r\n",
      "paper and put them into my bag; then she helped me on with my pelisse\r\n",
      "and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she and I left the\r\n",
      "nursery. As we passed Mrs. Reed’s bedroom, she said, “Will you go in\r\n",
      "and bid Missis good-bye?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to\r\n",
      "supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins\r\n",
      "either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best\r\n",
      "friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did you say, Miss?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to\r\n",
      "the wall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was wrong, Miss Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she\r\n",
      "has been my foe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“O Miss Jane! don’t say so!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye to Gateshead!” cried I, as we passed through the hall and\r\n",
      "went out at the front door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose\r\n",
      "light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw. Raw\r\n",
      "and chill was the winter morning: my teeth chattered as I hastened down\r\n",
      "the drive. There was a light in the porter’s lodge: when we reached it,\r\n",
      "we found the porter’s wife just kindling her fire: my trunk, which had\r\n",
      "been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door. It\r\n",
      "wanted but a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had\r\n",
      "struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach; I went\r\n",
      "to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is she going by herself?” asked the porter’s wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And how far is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fifty miles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far\r\n",
      "alone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and\r\n",
      "its top laden with passengers: the guard and coachman loudly urged\r\n",
      "haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie’s neck, to\r\n",
      "which I clung with kisses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be sure and take good care of her,” cried she to the guard, as he\r\n",
      "lifted me into the inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, ay!” was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed\r\n",
      "“All right,” and on we drove. Thus was I severed from Bessie and\r\n",
      "Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote\r\n",
      "and mysterious regions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed\r\n",
      "to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over\r\n",
      "hundreds of miles of road. We passed through several towns, and in one,\r\n",
      "a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the\r\n",
      "passengers alighted to dine. I was carried into an inn, where the guard\r\n",
      "wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he left me in\r\n",
      "an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from\r\n",
      "the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled\r\n",
      "with musical instruments. Here I walked about for a long time, feeling\r\n",
      "very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and\r\n",
      "kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having\r\n",
      "frequently figured in Bessie’s fireside chronicles. At last the guard\r\n",
      "returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector\r\n",
      "mounted his own seat, sounded his hollow horn, and away we rattled over\r\n",
      "the “stony street” of L——.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I\r\n",
      "began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we\r\n",
      "ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills\r\n",
      "heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a\r\n",
      "valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the\r\n",
      "prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered\r\n",
      "when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open,\r\n",
      "and a person like a servant was standing at it: I saw her face and\r\n",
      "dress by the light of the lamps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?” she asked. I answered\r\n",
      "“Yes,” and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach\r\n",
      "instantly drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion\r\n",
      "of the coach: gathering my faculties, I looked about me. Rain, wind,\r\n",
      "and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall\r\n",
      "before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new\r\n",
      "guide: she shut and locked it behind her. There was now visible a house\r\n",
      "or houses—for the building spread far—with many windows, and lights\r\n",
      "burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and\r\n",
      "were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into\r\n",
      "a room with a fire, where she left me alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze, then I looked\r\n",
      "round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth\r\n",
      "showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany\r\n",
      "furniture: it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the\r\n",
      "drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough. I was puzzling to\r\n",
      "make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened,\r\n",
      "and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close\r\n",
      "behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and\r\n",
      "large forehead; her figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her\r\n",
      "countenance was grave, her bearing erect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The child is very young to be sent alone,” said she, putting her\r\n",
      "candle down on the table. She considered me attentively for a minute or\r\n",
      "two, then further added—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?”\r\n",
      "she asked, placing her hand on my shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little, ma’am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to\r\n",
      "bed, Miss Miller. Is this the first time you have left your parents to\r\n",
      "come to school, my little girl?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I explained to her that I had no parents. She inquired how long they\r\n",
      "had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could\r\n",
      "read, write, and sew a little: then she touched my cheek gently with\r\n",
      "her forefinger, and saying, “She hoped I should be a good child,”\r\n",
      "dismissed me along with Miss Miller.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with\r\n",
      "me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her voice,\r\n",
      "look, and air. Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion,\r\n",
      "though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one\r\n",
      "who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she looked, indeed,\r\n",
      "what I afterwards found she really was, an under-teacher. Led by her, I\r\n",
      "passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a\r\n",
      "large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and\r\n",
      "somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had\r\n",
      "traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a\r\n",
      "wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of\r\n",
      "which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a\r\n",
      "congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty. Seen by\r\n",
      "the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless,\r\n",
      "though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in\r\n",
      "brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores. It\r\n",
      "was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their\r\n",
      "to-morrow’s task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of\r\n",
      "their whispered repetitions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking\r\n",
      "up to the top of the long room she cried out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered\r\n",
      "the books and removed them. Miss Miller again gave the word of command—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray,\r\n",
      "with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a\r\n",
      "pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray. The portions were\r\n",
      "handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug\r\n",
      "being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was\r\n",
      "thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering\r\n",
      "me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten\r\n",
      "cake shared into fragments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed\r\n",
      "off, two and two, upstairs. Overpowered by this time with weariness, I\r\n",
      "scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that,\r\n",
      "like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long. To-night I was to be Miss\r\n",
      "Miller’s bed-fellow; she helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced\r\n",
      "at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two\r\n",
      "occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst\r\n",
      "silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night passed rapidly: I was too tired even to dream; I only once\r\n",
      "awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in\r\n",
      "torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her place by my\r\n",
      "side. When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls\r\n",
      "were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or\r\n",
      "two burned in the room. I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and\r\n",
      "I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a\r\n",
      "basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin\r\n",
      "to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room. Again the bell\r\n",
      "rang: all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the\r\n",
      "stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were\r\n",
      "read by Miss Miller; afterwards she called out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Form classes!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller\r\n",
      "repeatedly exclaimed, “Silence!” and “Order!” When it subsided, I saw\r\n",
      "them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at\r\n",
      "the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like\r\n",
      "a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat. A pause of some\r\n",
      "seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss\r\n",
      "Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each\r\n",
      "walked to a table and took her seat; Miss Miller assumed the fourth\r\n",
      "vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the\r\n",
      "smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was\r\n",
      "called, and placed at the bottom of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Business now began: the day’s Collect was repeated, then certain texts\r\n",
      "of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of\r\n",
      "chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour. By the time that exercise\r\n",
      "was terminated, day had fully dawned. The indefatigable bell now\r\n",
      "sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched\r\n",
      "into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of\r\n",
      "getting something to eat! I was now nearly sick from inanition, having\r\n",
      "taken so little the day before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables\r\n",
      "smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent\r\n",
      "forth an odour far from inviting. I saw a universal manifestation of\r\n",
      "discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those\r\n",
      "destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls\r\n",
      "of the first class, rose the whispered words—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Silence!” ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the\r\n",
      "upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of\r\n",
      "somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table,\r\n",
      "while a more buxom lady presided at the other. I looked in vain for her\r\n",
      "I had first seen the night before; she was not visible: Miss Miller\r\n",
      "occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange,\r\n",
      "foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards\r\n",
      "found, took the corresponding seat at the other board. A long grace was\r\n",
      "said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the\r\n",
      "teachers, and the meal began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my\r\n",
      "portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger\r\n",
      "blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge\r\n",
      "is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over\r\n",
      "it. The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her food and\r\n",
      "try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.\r\n",
      "Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. Thanks being returned for\r\n",
      "what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was\r\n",
      "evacuated for the schoolroom. I was one of the last to go out, and in\r\n",
      "passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and\r\n",
      "taste it; she looked at the others; all their countenances expressed\r\n",
      "displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Abominable stuff! How shameful!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which\r\n",
      "the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it\r\n",
      "seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used\r\n",
      "their privilege. The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one\r\n",
      "and all abused roundly. Poor things! it was the sole consolation they\r\n",
      "had. Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great\r\n",
      "girls standing about her spoke with serious and sullen gestures. I\r\n",
      "heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which\r\n",
      "Miss Miller shook her head disapprovingly; but she made no great effort\r\n",
      "to check the general wrath; doubtless she shared in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her circle, and\r\n",
      "standing in the middle of the room, cried—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Silence! To your seats!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved\r\n",
      "into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of\r\n",
      "tongues. The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but\r\n",
      "still, all seemed to wait. Ranged on benches down the sides of the\r\n",
      "room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage\r\n",
      "they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl\r\n",
      "visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker\r\n",
      "about the throat, with little pockets of holland (shaped something like\r\n",
      "a Highlander’s purse) tied in front of their frocks, and destined to\r\n",
      "serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings\r\n",
      "and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles. Above twenty of\r\n",
      "those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young\r\n",
      "women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the\r\n",
      "prettiest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the\r\n",
      "teachers—none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a\r\n",
      "little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh\r\n",
      "and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing! looked purple,\r\n",
      "weather-beaten, and over-worked—when, as my eye wandered from face to\r\n",
      "face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common\r\n",
      "spring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. Ere I\r\n",
      "had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes\r\n",
      "were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and\r\n",
      "encountered the personage who had received me last night. She stood at\r\n",
      "the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at\r\n",
      "each end; she surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely. Miss\r\n",
      "Miller approaching, seemed to ask her a question, and having received\r\n",
      "her answer, went back to her place, and said aloud—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly\r\n",
      "up the room. I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I\r\n",
      "retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her\r\n",
      "steps. Seen now, in broad daylight, she looked tall, fair, and shapely;\r\n",
      "brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling\r\n",
      "of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her large front; on\r\n",
      "each of her temples her hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in\r\n",
      "round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither\r\n",
      "smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her dress, also in the\r\n",
      "mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish\r\n",
      "trimming of black velvet; a gold watch (watches were not so common then\r\n",
      "as now) shone at her girdle. Let the reader add, to complete the\r\n",
      "picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately\r\n",
      "air and carriage, and he will have, at least, as clearly as words can\r\n",
      "give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple—Maria Temple, as\r\n",
      "I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to\r\n",
      "carry to church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her\r\n",
      "seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the\r\n",
      "first class round her, and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the\r\n",
      "lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history,\r\n",
      "grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded,\r\n",
      "and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.\r\n",
      "The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last\r\n",
      "struck twelve. The superintendent rose—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it\r\n",
      "sank at her voice. She went on—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be\r\n",
      "hungry:—I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served\r\n",
      "to all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory\r\n",
      "tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the\r\n",
      "high delight and refreshment of the whole school. The order was now\r\n",
      "given “To the garden!” Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings\r\n",
      "of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze. I was similarly\r\n",
      "equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to\r\n",
      "exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one\r\n",
      "side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of\r\n",
      "little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to\r\n",
      "cultivate, and each bed had an owner. When full of flowers they would\r\n",
      "doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was\r\n",
      "wintry blight and brown decay. I shuddered as I stood and looked round\r\n",
      "me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy,\r\n",
      "but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still\r\n",
      "soaking wet with the floods of yesterday. The stronger among the girls\r\n",
      "ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones\r\n",
      "herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst\r\n",
      "these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard\r\n",
      "frequently the sound of a hollow cough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of\r\n",
      "me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was\r\n",
      "accustomed; it did not oppress me much. I leant against a pillar of the\r\n",
      "verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the\r\n",
      "cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed\r\n",
      "me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and\r\n",
      "thinking. My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit\r\n",
      "record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life\r\n",
      "seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague\r\n",
      "and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture. I looked\r\n",
      "round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house—a large\r\n",
      "building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.\r\n",
      "The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by\r\n",
      "mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a\r\n",
      "stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "LOWOOD INSTITUTION.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This portion was rebuilt A.D. ——, by Naomi Brocklehurst,\r\n",
      "of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works,\r\n",
      "and glorify your Father which is in heaven.”—St. Matt. v. 16.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I read these words over and over again: I felt that an explanation\r\n",
      "belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import. I was\r\n",
      "still pondering the signification of “Institution,” and endeavouring to\r\n",
      "make out a connection between the first words and the verse of\r\n",
      "Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my\r\n",
      "head. I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she was bent over a\r\n",
      "book, on the perusal of which she seemed intent: from where I stood I\r\n",
      "could see the title—it was “Rasselas;” a name that struck me as\r\n",
      "strange, and consequently attractive. In turning a leaf she happened to\r\n",
      "look up, and I said to her directly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is your book interesting?” I had already formed the intention of\r\n",
      "asking her to lend it to me some day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I like it,” she answered, after a pause of a second or two, during\r\n",
      "which she examined me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it about?” I continued. I hardly know where I found the\r\n",
      "hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was\r\n",
      "contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her occupation touched a\r\n",
      "chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a\r\n",
      "frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the\r\n",
      "serious or substantial.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may look at it,” replied the girl, offering me the book.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less\r\n",
      "taking than the title: “Rasselas” looked dull to my trifling taste; I\r\n",
      "saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety\r\n",
      "seemed spread over the closely-printed pages. I returned it to her; she\r\n",
      "received it quietly, and without saying anything she was about to\r\n",
      "relapse into her former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?\r\n",
      "What is Lowood Institution?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This house where you are come to live.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from\r\n",
      "other schools?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are\r\n",

      "father or your mother dead?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Both died before I can remember.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and\r\n",

      "“We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then why do they call us charity-children?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the\r\n",
      "large schoolroom. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree\r\n",
      "ignominious, especially for so great a girl—she looked thirteen or\r\n",
      "upwards. I expected she would show signs of great distress and shame;\r\n",

      "grave, she stood, the central mark of all eyes. “How can she bear it so\r\n",

      "if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment—beyond her\r\n",
      "situation: of something not round her nor before her. I have heard of\r\n",
      "day-dreams—is she in a day-dream now? Her eyes are fixed on the floor,\r\n",
      "but I am sure they do not see it—her sight seems turned in, gone down\r\n",
      "into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight;\r\n",
      "but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of\r\n",
      "washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place\r\n",
      "in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind,\r\n",
      "whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long,\r\n",
      "had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to\r\n",
      "ice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over,\r\n",
      "I felt ready to perish with cold. Breakfast-time came at last, and this\r\n",
      "morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the\r\n",
      "quantity small. How small my portion seemed! I wished it had been\r\n",
      "doubled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class,\r\n",
      "and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me: hitherto, I had\r\n",
      "only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become\r\n",
      "an actor therein. At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart,\r\n",
      "the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change\r\n",
      "from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three\r\n",
      "o’clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of\r\n",
      "muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me\r\n",
      "to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the\r\n",
      "same. At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one\r\n",
      "class still stood round Miss Scatcherd’s chair reading, and as all was\r\n",
      "quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the\r\n",
      "manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or\r\n",
      "commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance. It was English\r\n",
      "history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah:\r\n",
      "at the commencement of the lesson, her place had been at the top of the\r\n",
      "class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to\r\n",
      "stops, she was suddenly sent to the very bottom. Even in that obscure\r\n",
      "position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her an object of constant\r\n",
      "notice: she was continually addressing to her such phrases as the\r\n",
      "following:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Burns” (such it seems was her name: the girls here were all called by\r\n",
      "their surnames, as boys are elsewhere), “Burns, you are standing on the\r\n",
      "side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.” “Burns, you poke\r\n",
      "your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.” “Burns, I insist on your\r\n",
      "holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,”\r\n",
      "&c. &c.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the\r\n",
      "girls examined. The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles\r\n",
      "I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and\r\n",
      "ship-money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every\r\n",
      "little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her\r\n",
      "memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and\r\n",
      "she was ready with answers on every point. I kept expecting that Miss\r\n",
      "Scatcherd would praise her attention; but, instead of that, she\r\n",
      "suddenly cried out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this\r\n",
      "morning!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Burns made no answer: I wondered at her silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why,” thought I, “does she not explain that she could neither clean\r\n",
      "her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a\r\n",
      "skein of thread: while she was winding it, she talked to me from time\r\n",
      "to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I\r\n",
      "could mark, stitch, knit, &c.; till she dismissed me, I could not\r\n",
      "pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd’s movements. When I returned\r\n",
      "to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not\r\n",
      "catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into\r\n",
      "the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a\r\n",
      "minute, carrying in her hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one\r\n",
      "end. This ominous tool she presented to Miss Scatcherd with a\r\n",
      "respectful curtesy; then she quietly, and without being told, unloosed\r\n",
      "her pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her\r\n",
      "neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs. Not a tear rose to Burns’\r\n",
      "eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at\r\n",
      "this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a\r\n",
      "feature of her pensive face altered its ordinary expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hardened girl!” exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; “nothing can correct you of\r\n",
      "your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Burns obeyed: I looked at her narrowly as she emerged from the\r\n",
      "book-closet; she was just putting back her handkerchief into her\r\n",
      "pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her thin cheek.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The play-hour in the evening I thought the pleasantest fraction of the\r\n",
      "day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at\r\n",
      "five o’clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the\r\n",
      "long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer\r\n",
      "than in the morning—its fires being allowed to burn a little more\r\n",
      "brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet\r\n",
      "introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of\r\n",
      "many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her\r\n",
      "pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and\r\n",
      "laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I\r\n",
      "passed the windows, I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it\r\n",
      "snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes;\r\n",
      "putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the\r\n",
      "gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would\r\n",
      "have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the\r\n",
      "separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure\r\n",
      "chaos would have disturbed my peace! as it was, I derived from both a\r\n",
      "strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to\r\n",
      "howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to\r\n",
      "rise to clamour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of\r\n",
      "the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found\r\n",
      "Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her by the\r\n",
      "companionship of a book, which she read by the dim glare of the embers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it still ‘Rasselas’?” I asked, coming behind her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” she said, “and I have just finished it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in five minutes more she shut it up. I was glad of this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” thought I, “I can perhaps get her to talk.” I sat down by her on\r\n",
      "the floor.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No! why should I? I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it\r\n",
      "would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Cruel? Not at all! She is severe: she dislikes my faults.”\r\n",

      "grief to your relations. It is far better to endure patiently a smart\r\n",
      "which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose\r\n",
      "evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides,\r\n",

      "Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes. I suspected\r\n",
      "she might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter\r\n",

      "particular.”\r\n",

      "to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is\r\n",
      "singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is\r\n",
      "often just what I wished to gain.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I\r\n",
      "ever desire to be. If people were always kind and obedient to those who\r\n",
      "are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own\r\n",
      "way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but\r\n",
      "would grow worse and worse. When we are struck at without a reason, we\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age\r\n",
      "either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in\r\n",
      "habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure\r\n",
      "in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my\r\n",
      "lot; though these were no trifles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after\r\n",
      "their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring\r\n",
      "beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these\r\n",
      "limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing\r\n",
      "was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots,\r\n",
      "the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became\r\n",
      "numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well\r\n",
      "the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening,\r\n",
      "when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw,\r\n",
      "and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of\r\n",
      "food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we\r\n",
      "had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this\r\n",
      "deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on\r\n",
      "the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an\r\n",
      "opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their\r\n",
      "portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious\r\n",
      "morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing\r\n",
      "to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the\r\n",
      "remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the\r\n",
      "exigency of hunger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season. We had to walk two\r\n",
      "miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out\r\n",
      "cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became\r\n",
      "almost paralysed. It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance\r\n",
      "of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in\r\n",
      "our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and\r\n",
      "hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy\r\n",
      "summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our\r\n",
      "drooping line, her plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered,\r\n",
      "gathered close about her, and encouraging us, by precept and example,\r\n",
      "to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she said, “like stalwart\r\n",
      "soldiers.” The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves\r\n",
      "too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got\r\n",
      "back! But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in\r\n",
      "the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great\r\n",
      "girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups,\r\n",
      "wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of\r\n",
      "bread—a whole, instead of a half, slice—with the delicious addition of\r\n",
      "a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all\r\n",
      "looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to\r\n",
      "reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder\r\n",
      "I was invariably obliged to part with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church\r\n",
      "Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew;\r\n",
      "and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose\r\n",
      "irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of\r\n",
      "these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some\r\n",
      "half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall\r\n",
      "down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be\r\n",
      "taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the\r\n",
      "centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the\r\n",
      "sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank\r\n",
      "together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors’ high\r\n",
      "stools.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed\r\n",
      "that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month\r\n",
      "after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the\r\n",
      "archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had\r\n",
      "my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting\r\n",
      "with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes,\r\n",
      "raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just\r\n",
      "passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and\r\n",
      "when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose _en\r\n",
      "masse_, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain\r\n",
      "whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the\r\n",
      "schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen,\r\n",
      "stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from\r\n",
      "the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of\r\n",
      "architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in\r\n",
      "a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I\r\n",
      "remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my\r\n",
      "disposition, &c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise\r\n",
      "Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been\r\n",
      "dreading the fulfilment of this promise,—I had been looking out daily\r\n",
      "for the “Coming Man,” whose information respecting my past life and\r\n",
      "conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood at Miss Temple’s side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did\r\n",
      "not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her\r\n",
      "eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb\r\n",
      "turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as\r\n",
      "I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of\r\n",
      "what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it\r\n",
      "struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises,\r\n",
      "and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I\r\n",
      "forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have\r\n",
      "some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give\r\n",
      "out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are\r\n",
      "apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma’am! I wish the woollen\r\n",
      "stockings were better looked to!—when I was here last, I went into the\r\n",
      "kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a\r\n",
      "quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of\r\n",
      "the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to\r\n",
      "time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your directions shall be attended to, sir,” said Miss Temple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And, ma’am,” he continued, “the laundress tells me some of the girls\r\n",
      "have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit\r\n",
      "them to one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. Agnes and Catherine\r\n",
      "Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last\r\n",
      "Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the\r\n",
      "occasion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance\r\n",
      "occur too often. And there is another thing which surprised me; I find,\r\n",
      "in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of\r\n",
      "bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the\r\n",
      "past fortnight. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find\r\n",
      "no such meal as lunch mentioned. Who introduced this innovation? and by\r\n",
      "what authority?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,” replied Miss Temple:\r\n",
      "“the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly\r\n",
      "eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up\r\n",
      "these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and\r\n",
      "indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any\r\n",
      "little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the\r\n",
      "spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the\r\n",
      "incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more\r\n",
      "delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the\r\n",
      "aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual\r\n",
      "edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude\r\n",
      "under the temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would\r\n",
      "not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the\r\n",
      "opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians;\r\n",
      "to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord\r\n",
      "Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow\r\n",
      "Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by\r\n",
      "every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine\r\n",
      "consolations, ‘If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are\r\n",
      "ye.’ Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt\r\n",
      "porridge, into these children’s mouths, you may indeed feed their vile\r\n",
      "bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brocklehurst again paused—perhaps overcome by his feelings. Miss\r\n",
      "Temple had looked down when he first began to speak to her; but she now\r\n",
      "gazed straight before her, and her face, naturally pale as marble,\r\n",
      "appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material;\r\n",
      "especially her mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor’s\r\n",
      "chisel to open it, and her brow settled gradually into petrified\r\n",
      "severity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his hands\r\n",
      "behind his back, majestically surveyed the whole school. Suddenly his\r\n",
      "eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or\r\n",
      "shocked its pupil; turning, he said in more rapid accents than he had\r\n",
      "hitherto used—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what—_what_ is that girl with curled hair?\r\n",
      "Red hair, ma’am, curled—curled all over?” And extending his cane he\r\n",
      "pointed to the awful object, his hand shaking as he did so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is Julia Severn,” replied Miss Temple, very quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Julia Severn, ma’am! And why has she, or any other, curled hair? Why,\r\n",
      "in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she\r\n",
      "conform to the world so openly—here in an evangelical, charitable\r\n",
      "establishment—as to wear her hair one mass of curls?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Julia’s hair curls naturally,” returned Miss Temple, still more\r\n",
      "quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Naturally! Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these\r\n",
      "girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance? I have again\r\n",
      "and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely,\r\n",
      "modestly, plainly. Miss Temple, that girl’s hair must be cut off\r\n",
      "entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far\r\n",
      "too much of the excrescence—that tall girl, tell her to turn round.\r\n",
      "Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Temple passed her handkerchief over her lips, as if to smooth away\r\n",
      "the involuntary smile that curled them; she gave the order, however,\r\n",
      "and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they\r\n",
      "obeyed. Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and\r\n",
      "grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr.\r\n",
      "Brocklehurst could not see them too; he would perhaps have felt that,\r\n",
      "whatever he might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the\r\n",
      "inside was further beyond his interference than he imagined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes,\r\n",
      "then pronounced sentence. These words fell like the knell of doom—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All those top-knots must be cut off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam,” he pursued, “I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of\r\n",
      "this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the\r\n",
      "flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and\r\n",
      "sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the\r\n",
      "young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which\r\n",
      "vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think\r\n",
      "of the time wasted, of—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies,\r\n",
      "now entered the room. They ought to have come a little sooner to have\r\n",
      "heard his lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet,\r\n",
      "silk, and furs. The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and\r\n",
      "seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich\r\n",
      "plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a\r\n",
      "profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was\r\n",
      "enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a\r\n",
      "false front of French curls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and\r\n",
      "the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of\r\n",
      "the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend\r\n",
      "relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room\r\n",
      "upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned\r\n",
      "the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to\r\n",
      "address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with\r\n",
      "the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had\r\n",
      "no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and\r\n",
      "enchanted my attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss\r\n",
      "Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my\r\n",
      "personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only\r\n",
      "elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and\r\n",
      "while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a\r\n",
      "manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my\r\n",
      "treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling\r\n",
      "with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it\r\n",
      "was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of\r\n",
      "slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A careless girl!” said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after—“It is\r\n",
      "the new pupil, I perceive.” And before I could draw breath, “I must not\r\n",
      "forget I have a word to say respecting her.” Then aloud: how loud it\r\n",
      "seemed to me! “Let the child who broke her slate come forward!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two\r\n",
      "great girls who sat on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me\r\n",
      "towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his\r\n",
      "very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be\r\n",
      "punished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,” thought I;\r\n",
      "and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in\r\n",
      "my pulses at the conviction. I was no Helen Burns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fetch that stool,” said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one\r\n",
      "from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Place the child upon it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I was placed there, by whom I don’t know: I was in no condition to\r\n",
      "note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the\r\n",
      "height of Mr. Brocklehurst’s nose, that he was within a yard of me, and\r\n",
      "that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of\r\n",
      "silvery plumage extended and waved below me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ladies,” said he, turning to his family, “Miss Temple, teachers, and\r\n",
      "children, you all see this girl?”\r\n",

      "feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave\r\n",
      "or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising\r\n",

      "smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and\r\n",

      "Ere the half-hour ended, five o’clock struck; school was dismissed, and\r\n",
      "all were gone into the refectory to tea. I now ventured to descend: it\r\n",
      "was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. The\r\n",
      "spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction\r\n",
      "took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me, I\r\n",
      "sank prostrate with my face to the ground. Now I wept: Helen Burns was\r\n",
      "not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and\r\n",
      "my tears watered the boards. I had meant to be so good, and to do so\r\n",
      "much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win\r\n",
      "affection. Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had\r\n",
      "reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss\r\n",
      "Temple had smiled approbation; she had promised to teach me drawing,\r\n",
      "and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement\r\n",
      "two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils;\r\n",
      "treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any;\r\n",
      "now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise\r\n",
      "more?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never,” I thought; and ardently I wished to die. While sobbing out\r\n",
      "this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up—again\r\n",
      "Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her coming up the\r\n",
      "long, vacant room; she brought my coffee and bread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, eat something,” she said; but I put both away from me, feeling\r\n",
      "as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.\r\n",
      "Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my\r\n",
      "agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud. She sat down\r\n",
      "on the ground near me, embraced her knees with her arms, and rested her\r\n",
      "head upon them; in that attitude she remained silent as an Indian. I\r\n",
      "was the first who spoke—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a\r\n",
      "liar?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“But what have I to do with millions? The eighty I know despise me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises\r\n",

      "“Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man:\r\n",
      "he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked. Had\r\n",
      "he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies,\r\n",
      "declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would\r\n",
      "offer you sympathy if they dared. Teachers and pupils may look coldly\r\n",
      "on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their\r\n",
      "hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere\r\n",
      "long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.\r\n",
      "Besides, Jane”—she paused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers\r\n",
      "gently to warm them, and went on—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own\r\n",

      "without friends.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if\r\n",
      "others don’t love me I would rather die than live—I cannot bear to be\r\n",
      "solitary and hated, Helen. Look here; to gain some real affection from\r\n",
      "you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly\r\n",
      "submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or\r\n",
      "to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are\r\n",
      "too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your\r\n",
      "frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than\r\n",
      "your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you. Besides this earth,\r\n",
      "and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom\r\n",
      "of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those\r\n",
      "spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were\r\n",
      "dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred\r\n",
      "crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if\r\n",
      "innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst\r\n",
      "has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I\r\n",
      "read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and\r\n",
      "God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a\r\n",
      "full reward. Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress,\r\n",
      "when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to\r\n",
      "happiness—to glory?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she imparted\r\n",
      "there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness. I felt the impression of\r\n",
      "woe as she spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having\r\n",
      "done speaking, she breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I\r\n",
      "momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Resting my head on Helen’s shoulder, I put my arms round her waist; she\r\n",
      "drew me to her, and we reposed in silence. We had not sat long thus,\r\n",
      "when another person came in. Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a\r\n",
      "rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her light, streaming in\r\n",
      "through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching\r\n",
      "figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,” said she; “I want you in my\r\n",
      "room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went; following the superintendent’s guidance, we had to thread some\r\n",
      "intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her\r\n",
      "apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful. Miss Temple\r\n",
      "told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the\r\n",
      "hearth, and herself taking another, she called me to her side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it all over?” she asked, looking down at my face. “Have you cried\r\n",
      "your grief away?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am afraid I never shall do that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma’am, and everybody\r\n",
      "else, will now think me wicked.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue\r\n",
      "to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I, Miss Temple?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will,” said she, passing her arm round me. “And now tell me who is\r\n",
      "the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Reed, my uncle’s wife. My uncle is dead, and he left me to her\r\n",
      "care.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, ma’am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have\r\n",
      "often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that\r\n",
      "she would always keep me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a\r\n",
      "criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence.\r\n",
      "You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as\r\n",
      "you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and\r\n",
      "exaggerate nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most\r\n",
      "moderate—most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to\r\n",
      "arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her all the story of my\r\n",
      "sad childhood. Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than\r\n",
      "it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of\r\n",
      "Helen’s warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into\r\n",
      "the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary. Thus\r\n",
      "restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went\r\n",
      "on that Miss Temple fully believed me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to\r\n",
      "see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode\r\n",
      "of the red-room: in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some\r\n",
      "degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection\r\n",
      "the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my\r\n",
      "wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark\r\n",
      "and haunted chamber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she\r\n",
      "then said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply\r\n",
      "agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every\r\n",
      "imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She kissed me, and still keeping me at her side (where I was well\r\n",
      "contented to stand, for I derived a child’s pleasure from the\r\n",
      "contemplation of her face, her dress, her one or two ornaments, her\r\n",
      "white forehead, her clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark\r\n",
      "eyes), she proceeded to address Helen Burns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How are you to-night, Helen? Have you coughed much to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not quite so much, I think, ma’am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the pain in your chest?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a little better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Temple got up, took her hand and examined her pulse; then she\r\n",
      "returned to her own seat: as she resumed it, I heard her sigh low. She\r\n",
      "was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she said cheerfully—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.” She\r\n",
      "rang her bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Barbara,” she said to the servant who answered it, “I have not yet had\r\n",
      "tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And a tray was soon brought. How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups\r\n",
      "and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!\r\n",
      "How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!\r\n",
      "of which, however, I, to my dismay (for I was beginning to be hungry)\r\n",
      "discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Barbara,” said she, “can you not bring a little more bread and butter?\r\n",
      "There is not enough for three.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Barbara went out: she returned soon—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr.\r\n",
      "Brocklehurst’s own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, very well!” returned Miss Temple; “we must make it do, Barbara, I\r\n",
      "suppose.” And as the girl withdrew she added, smiling, “Fortunately, I\r\n",
      "have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before\r\n",
      "each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast,\r\n",
      "she got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in\r\n",
      "paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,” said she,\r\n",
      "“but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,” and she\r\n",
      "proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least\r\n",
      "delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which\r\n",
      "our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the\r\n",
      "delicate fare she liberally supplied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tea over and the tray removed, she again summoned us to the fire; we\r\n",
      "sat one on each side of her, and now a conversation followed between\r\n",
      "her and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her air, of state in\r\n",
      "her mien, of refined propriety in her language, which precluded\r\n",
      "deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which\r\n",
      "chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her and listened to her,\r\n",
      "by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to\r\n",
      "Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of\r\n",
      "her beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something\r\n",
      "in her own unique mind, had roused her powers within her. They woke,\r\n",
      "they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her cheek, which\r\n",
      "till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone\r\n",
      "in the liquid lustre of her eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty\r\n",
      "more singular than that of Miss Temple’s—a beauty neither of fine\r\n",
      "colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of\r\n",
      "movement, of radiance. Then her soul sat on her lips, and language\r\n",
      "flowed, from what source I cannot tell. Has a girl of fourteen a heart\r\n",
      "large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure,\r\n",
      "full, fervid eloquence? Such was the characteristic of Helen’s\r\n",
      "discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her spirit seemed\r\n",
      "hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during\r\n",
      "a protracted existence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times\r\n",
      "past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed\r\n",
      "at: they spoke of books: how many they had read! What stores of\r\n",
      "knowledge they possessed! Then they seemed so familiar with French\r\n",

      "entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that\r\n",

      "the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she was most happy to\r\n",
      "be able to pronounce her completely cleared from every imputation. The\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh,\r\n",

      "imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread\r\n",
      "and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I\r\n",

      "at ripe cherries, of wren’s nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed\r\n",
      "about with young ivy sprays. I examined, too, in thought, the\r\n",

      "But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened. Spring\r\n",
      "drew on: she was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased;\r\n",
      "its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated. My wretched feet,\r\n",
      "flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to\r\n",
      "heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and\r\n",
      "mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood\r\n",
      "in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden:\r\n",
      "sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a\r\n",
      "greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily,\r\n",
      "suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each\r\n",
      "morning brighter traces of her steps. Flowers peeped out amongst the\r\n",
      "leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed\r\n",
      "pansies. On Thursday afternoons (half-holidays) we now took walks, and\r\n",
      "found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the\r\n",
      "horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls\r\n",
      "of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits\r\n",
      "girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright\r\n",
      "beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies. How different had this\r\n",
      "scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter,\r\n",
      "stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!—when mists as chill as death\r\n",
      "wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and\r\n",
      "rolled down “ing” and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the\r\n",
      "beck! That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore\r\n",
      "asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often\r\n",
      "thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its\r\n",
      "banks, _that_ showed only ranks of skeletons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky,\r\n",
      "placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its\r\n",
      "duration. And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose\r\n",
      "its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and\r\n",
      "oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up\r\n",
      "profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its\r\n",
      "hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its\r\n",
      "wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed\r\n",
      "spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre. All this I enjoyed often\r\n",
      "and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty\r\n",
      "and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to\r\n",
      "advert.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it\r\n",
      "as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?\r\n",
      "Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another\r\n",

      "That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred\r\n",

      "the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and\r\n",
      "dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an\r\n",
      "hospital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils\r\n",
      "to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one\r\n",
      "time. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. The few who continued well\r\n",
      "were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant\r\n",
      "insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health:\r\n",
      "and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain\r\n",
      "them. Miss Temple’s whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she\r\n",
      "lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours’\r\n",
      "rest at night. The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and\r\n",
      "making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls\r\n",
      "who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and\r\n",
      "willing to remove them from the seat of contagion. Many, already\r\n",
      "smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were\r\n",
      "buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its\r\n",
      "frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls;\r\n",
      "while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and\r\n",
      "the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality,\r\n",
      "that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful\r\n",
      "woodland out of doors. Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks\r\n",
      "had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were\r\n",
      "in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and\r\n",
      "crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening,\r\n",
      "their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all\r\n",
      "useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and\r\n",
      "then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of\r\n",
      "the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies,\r\n",
      "from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we\r\n",
      "lived better too. Mr. Brocklehurst and his family never came near\r\n",
      "Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross\r\n",
      "housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her\r\n",
      "successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the\r\n",
      "ways of her new abode, provided with comparative liberality. Besides,\r\n",
      "there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our\r\n",
      "breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare\r\n",
      "a regular dinner, which often happened, she would give us a large piece\r\n",
      "of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried\r\n",
      "away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best,\r\n",
      "and dined sumptuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry\r\n",
      "from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading\r\n",
      "through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot. The stone was just\r\n",
      "broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that\r\n",
      "time my chosen comrade—one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant\r\n",
      "personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she was\r\n",
      "witty and original, and partly because she had a manner which set me at\r\n",
      "my ease. Some years older than I, she knew more of the world, and could\r\n",
      "tell me many things I liked to hear: with her my curiosity found\r\n",
      "gratification: to my faults also she gave ample indulgence, never\r\n",
      "imposing curb or rein on anything I said. She had a turn for narrative,\r\n",
      "I for analysis; she liked to inform, I to question; so we got on\r\n",
      "swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much\r\n",
      "improvement, from our mutual intercourse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And where, meantime, was Helen Burns? Why did I not spend these sweet\r\n",
      "days of liberty with her? Had I forgotten her? or was I so worthless as\r\n",
      "to have grown tired of her pure society? Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I\r\n",
      "have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she could only\r\n",
      "tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I\r\n",
      "chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she was\r\n",
      "qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her converse a\r\n",
      "taste of far higher things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective\r\n",
      "being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of\r\n",
      "Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her a sentiment of\r\n",
      "attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated\r\n",
      "my heart. How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under\r\n",
      "all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship,\r\n",
      "which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled? But Helen\r\n",
      "was ill at present: for some weeks she had been removed from my sight\r\n",
      "to I knew not what room upstairs. She was not, I was told, in the\r\n",
      "hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her\r\n",
      "complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my\r\n",
      "ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure\r\n",
      "to alleviate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her once or twice coming\r\n",
      "downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss\r\n",
      "Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to\r\n",
      "go and speak to her; I only saw her from the schoolroom window, and\r\n",
      "then not distinctly; for she was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance\r\n",
      "under the verandah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with\r\n",
      "Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the\r\n",
      "others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to\r\n",
      "ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked\r\n",
      "after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood. When\r\n",
      "we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the\r\n",
      "surgeon’s, was standing at the garden door. Mary Ann remarked that she\r\n",
      "supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at\r\n",
      "that time of the evening. She went into the house; I stayed behind a\r\n",
      "few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in\r\n",
      "the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the\r\n",
      "morning. This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt\r\n",
      "so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so\r\n",
      "warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the\r\n",
      "morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east. I was noting\r\n",
      "these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my\r\n",
      "mind as it had never done before:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!\r\n",
      "This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to\r\n",
      "have to go who knows where?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had\r\n",
      "been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time\r\n",
      "it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each\r\n",
      "side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the\r\n",
      "one point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud\r\n",
      "and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and\r\n",
      "plunging amid that chaos. While pondering this new idea, I heard the\r\n",
      "front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him was a nurse. After\r\n",
      "she had seen him mount his horse and depart, she was about to close the\r\n",
      "door, but I ran up to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is Helen Burns?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very poorly,” was the answer.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what does he say about her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He says she’ll not be here long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed\r\n",
      "the notion that she was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her\r\n",
      "own home. I should not have suspected that it meant she was dying; but\r\n",
      "I knew instantly now! It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen\r\n",
      "Burns was numbering her last days in this world, and that she was going\r\n",
      "to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were. I\r\n",
      "experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a\r\n",
      "desire—a necessity to see her; and I asked in what room she lay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is in Miss Temple’s room,” said the nurse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I go up and speak to her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, child! It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in;\r\n",
      "you’ll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which\r\n",
      "led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o’clock, and\r\n",
      "Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I—not having\r\n",
      "been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the\r\n",
      "dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose—rose\r\n",
      "softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept\r\n",
      "from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple’s room. It was\r\n",
      "quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light\r\n",
      "of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage\r\n",
      "windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty. An odour of camphor\r\n",
      "and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I\r\n",
      "passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night\r\n",
      "should hear me. I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I _must_\r\n",
      "see Helen,—I must embrace her before she died,—I must give her one last\r\n",
      "kiss, exchange with her one last word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below,\r\n",
      "and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I\r\n",
      "reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just\r\n",
      "opposite to me was Miss Temple’s room. A light shone through the\r\n",
      "keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the\r\n",
      "vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to\r\n",
      "admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness. Indisposed to\r\n",
      "hesitate, and full of impatient impulses—soul and senses quivering with\r\n",
      "keen throes—I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and\r\n",
      "feared to find death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Close by Miss Temple’s bed, and half covered with its white curtains,\r\n",
      "there stood a little crib. I saw the outline of a form under the\r\n",
      "clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken\r\n",
      "to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt\r\n",
      "dimly on the table. Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards\r\n",
      "that she had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room. I\r\n",
      "advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but\r\n",
      "I preferred speaking before I withdrew it. I still recoiled at the\r\n",
      "dread of seeing a corpse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Helen!” I whispered softly, “are you awake?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her face, pale,\r\n",
      "wasted, but quite composed: she looked so little changed that my fear\r\n",
      "was instantly dissipated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can it be you, Jane?” she asked, in her own gentle voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh!” I thought, “she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could\r\n",

      "gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest. I leave no one to regret me\r\n",
      "much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss\r\n",
      "me. By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. I had not\r\n",

      "existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as\r\n",
      "many chapters. But this is not to be a regular autobiography: I am only\r\n",
      "bound to invoke Memory where I know her responses will possess some\r\n",
      "degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost\r\n",

      "Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its\r\n",
      "virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on\r\n",
      "the school. Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by\r\n",
      "degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a\r\n",
      "high degree. The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality\r\n",
      "of the children’s food; the brackish, fetid water used in its\r\n",
      "preparation; the pupils’ wretched clothing and accommodations—all these\r\n",
      "things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying\r\n",
      "to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed\r\n",
      "largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better\r\n",
      "situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing\r\n",
      "introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of\r\n",
      "a committee. Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his wealth and family\r\n",
      "connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of\r\n",
      "treasurer; but he was aided in the discharge of his duties by gentlemen\r\n",
      "of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his office of\r\n",
      "inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with\r\n",
      "strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness. The\r\n",
      "school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble\r\n",
      "institution. I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration,\r\n",
      "for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both\r\n",
      "capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because\r\n",
      "it was not inactive. I had the means of an excellent education placed\r\n",
      "within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to\r\n",
      "excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers,\r\n",
      "especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the\r\n",
      "advantages offered me. In time I rose to be the first girl of the first\r\n",
      "class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I\r\n",
      "discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I\r\n",
      "altered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent\r\n",
      "of the seminary: to her instruction I owed the best part of my\r\n",
      "acquirements; her friendship and society had been my continual solace;\r\n",
      "she had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly,\r\n",
      "companion. At this period she married, removed with her husband (a\r\n",
      "clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife) to a distant\r\n",
      "county, and consequently was lost to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the day she left I was no longer the same: with her was gone every\r\n",
      "settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree\r\n",
      "a home to me. I had imbibed from her something of her nature and much\r\n",
      "of her habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated\r\n",
      "feelings had become the inmates of my mind. I had given in allegiance\r\n",
      "to duty and order; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes\r\n",
      "of others, usually even to my own, I appeared a disciplined and subdued\r\n",
      "character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and\r\n",
      "Miss Temple: I saw her in her travelling dress step into a post-chaise,\r\n",
      "shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the\r\n",
      "hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room,\r\n",
      "and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday\r\n",
      "granted in honour of the occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I walked about the chamber most of the time. I imagined myself only to\r\n",
      "be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my\r\n",
      "reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the\r\n",
      "afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned\r\n",
      "on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming\r\n",
      "process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple—or\r\n",
      "rather that she had taken with her the serene atmosphere I had been\r\n",
      "breathing in her vicinity—and that now I was left in my natural\r\n",
      "element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions. It did not\r\n",
      "seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone:\r\n",
      "it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason\r\n",
      "for tranquillity was no more. My world had for some years been in\r\n",
      "Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I\r\n",
      "remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of\r\n",
      "hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had\r\n",
      "courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life\r\n",
      "amidst its perils.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. There were the two\r\n",
      "wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of\r\n",
      "Lowood; there was the hilly horizon. My eye passed all other objects to\r\n",
      "rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to\r\n",
      "surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed\r\n",
      "prison-ground, exile limits. I traced the white road winding round the\r\n",
      "base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I\r\n",
      "longed to follow it farther! I recalled the time when I had travelled\r\n",
      "that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at\r\n",
      "twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me\r\n",
      "first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since. My vacations had all\r\n",
      "been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead;\r\n",
      "neither she nor any of her family had ever been to visit me. I had had\r\n",
      "no communication by letter or message with the outer world:\r\n",
      "school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and\r\n",
      "faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies—such\r\n",
      "was what I knew of existence. And now I felt that it was not enough; I\r\n",
      "tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I desired\r\n",
      "liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it\r\n",
      "seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing. I abandoned it and\r\n",
      "framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition,\r\n",
      "too, seemed swept off into vague space: “Then,” I cried, half\r\n",
      "desperate, “grant me at least a new servitude!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till\r\n",
      "bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me\r\n",
      "from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of\r\n",
      "small talk. How I wished sleep would silence her. It seemed as if,\r\n",
      "could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I\r\n",
      "stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my\r\n",
      "relief.\r\n",

      "Miss Gryce snored at last; she was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her\r\n",
      "habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light\r\n",
      "than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with\r\n",
      "satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced\r\n",
      "thought instantly revived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A new servitude! There is something in that,” I soliloquised\r\n",
      "(mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud). “I know there is,\r\n",
      "because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as\r\n",
      "Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more\r\n",
      "than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of\r\n",
      "time to listen to them. But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any\r\n",
      "one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to\r\n",
      "serve elsewhere. Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing\r\n",
      "feasible? Yes—yes—the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain\r\n",
      "active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly\r\n",
      "night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded _to\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in\r\n",
      "chaos; and no result came of its efforts. Feverish with vain labour, I\r\n",
      "got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or\r\n",

      "situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little\r\n",
      "girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per\r\n",
      "annum. J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all\r\n",
      "particulars to the direction:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ——shire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather\r\n",
      "uncertain, like that of an elderly lady. This circumstance was\r\n",
      "satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for\r\n",
      "myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some\r\n",
      "scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to\r\n",
      "be respectable, proper, _en règle_. I now felt that an elderly lady was\r\n",
      "no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! I saw\r\n",
      "her in a black gown and widow’s cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil:\r\n",
      "a model of elderly English respectability. Thornfield! that, doubtless,\r\n",
      "was the name of her house: a neat orderly spot, I was sure; though I\r\n",
      "failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.\r\n",
      "Millcote, ——shire; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England;\r\n",
      "yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town. ——shire was seventy miles\r\n",
      "nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a\r\n",
      "recommendation to me. I longed to go where there was life and movement:\r\n",
      "Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A——: a busy\r\n",
      "place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete\r\n",
      "change at least. Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of\r\n",
      "long chimneys and clouds of smoke—“but,” I argued, “Thornfield will,\r\n",
      "probably, be a good way from the town.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be\r\n",
      "confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their\r\n",
      "success. Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent\r\n",
      "during the noontide recreation, I told her I had a prospect of getting\r\n",
      "a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received\r\n",
      "(for at Lowood I only got £15 per annum); and requested she would break\r\n",
      "the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and\r\n",
      "ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.\r\n",
      "She obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter. The next\r\n",
      "day she laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reed must be written to, as she was my natural guardian. A note was\r\n",
      "accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that “I\r\n",
      "might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my\r\n",
      "affairs.” This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after\r\n",
      "what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to\r\n",
      "better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had\r\n",
      "always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a\r\n",
      "testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that\r\n",
      "institution, should forthwith be furnished me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a\r\n",
      "copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady’s reply, stating that she\r\n",
      "was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my\r\n",
      "assuming the post of governess in her house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. I\r\n",
      "had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and\r\n",
      "the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,—the same I had brought with me\r\n",
      "eight years ago from Gateshead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The box was corded, the card nailed on. In half-an-hour the carrier was\r\n",
      "to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at\r\n",
      "an early hour the next morning to meet the coach. I had brushed my\r\n",
      "black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff;\r\n",
      "sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and\r\n",
      "now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest. I could\r\n",
      "not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an\r\n",
      "instant; I was too much excited. A phase of my life was closing\r\n",
      "to-night, a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the\r\n",
      "interval; I must watch feverishly while the change was being\r\n",
      "accomplished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss,” said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering\r\n",
      "like a troubled spirit, “a person below wishes to see you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The carrier, no doubt,” I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry.\r\n",
      "I was passing the back-parlour or teachers’ sitting-room, the door of\r\n",
      "which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s her, I am sure!—I could have told her anywhere!” cried the\r\n",
      "individual who stopped my progress and took my hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked: I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly,\r\n",
      "yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and\r\n",
      "lively complexion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, who is it?” she asked, in a voice and with a smile I half\r\n",
      "recognised; “you’ve not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another second I was embracing and kissing her rapturously: “Bessie!\r\n",
      "Bessie! Bessie!” that was all I said; whereat she half laughed, half\r\n",
      "cried, and we both went into the parlour. By the fire stood a little\r\n",
      "fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is my little boy,” said Bessie directly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you are married, Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I’ve\r\n",
      "a little girl besides Bobby there, that I’ve christened Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you don’t live at Gateshead?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them,\r\n",
      "Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will\r\n",
      "you?” but Bobby preferred sidling over to his mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,”\r\n",
      "continued Mrs. Leaven. “I dare say they’ve not kept you too well at\r\n",
      "school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and\r\n",
      "Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very. She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there\r\n",
      "everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his\r\n",
      "relations were against the match; and—what do you think?—he and Miss\r\n",
      "Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.\r\n",
      "It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and\r\n",
      "now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are\r\n",
      "always quarrelling—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and what of John Reed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish. He went to\r\n",
      "college, and he got—plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles\r\n",
      "wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a\r\n",
      "dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does he look like?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he\r\n",
      "has such thick lips.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Mrs. Reed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she’s not\r\n",
      "quite easy in her mind: Mr. John’s conduct does not please her—he\r\n",
      "spends a deal of money.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did she send you here, Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that\r\n",
      "there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another\r\n",
      "part of the country, I thought I’d just set off, and get a look at you\r\n",
      "before you were quite out of my reach.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.” I said this laughing:\r\n",
      "I perceived that Bessie’s glance, though it expressed regard, did in no\r\n",
      "shape denote admiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a\r\n",
      "lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty\r\n",
      "as a child.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I smiled at Bessie’s frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I\r\n",
      "confess I was not quite indifferent to its import: at eighteen most\r\n",
      "people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an\r\n",
      "exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but\r\n",
      "gratification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dare say you are clever, though,” continued Bessie, by way of\r\n",
      "solace. “What can you do? Can you play on the piano?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me\r\n",
      "to sit down and give her a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she was\r\n",
      "charmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The Miss Reeds could not play as well!” said she exultingly. “I always\r\n",
      "said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.” It was a\r\n",
      "landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the\r\n",
      "superintendent, in acknowledgment of her obliging mediation with the\r\n",
      "committee on my behalf, and which she had framed and glazed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! It is as fine a picture as any\r\n",
      "Miss Reed’s drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies\r\n",
      "themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you can work on muslin and canvas?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane! I knew you would be: you will get\r\n",
      "on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I\r\n",
      "wanted to ask you. Have you ever heard anything from your father’s\r\n",
      "kinsfolk, the Eyres?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never in my life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable:\r\n",
      "and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the\r\n",
      "Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to\r\n",
      "Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty\r\n",
      "miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he\r\n",
      "was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail\r\n",
      "from London in a day or two. He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe\r\n",
      "he was your father’s brother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine—the butler did\r\n",
      "tell me—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madeira?” I suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, that is it—that is the very word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So he went?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high\r\n",
      "with him; she called him afterwards a ‘sneaking tradesman.’ My Robert\r\n",
      "believes he was a wine-merchant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very likely,” I returned; “or perhaps clerk or agent to a\r\n",
      "wine-merchant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she was\r\n",
      "obliged to leave me: I saw her again for a few minutes the next morning\r\n",
      "at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach. We parted finally at the\r\n",
      "door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her separate way; she\r\n",
      "set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and\r\n",
      "when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a\r\n",
      "room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on\r\n",
      "the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such\r\n",
      "ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of\r\n",
      "George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a\r\n",
      "representation of the death of Wolfe. All this is visible to you by the\r\n",
      "light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an\r\n",
      "excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and\r\n",
      "umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill\r\n",
      "contracted by sixteen hours’ exposure to the rawness of an October day:\r\n",
      "I left Lowton at four o’clock A.M., and the Millcote town clock is now\r\n",
      "just striking eight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil\r\n",
      "in my mind. I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some\r\n",
      "one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden\r\n",
      "steps the “boots” placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name\r\n",
      "pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey\r\n",
      "me to Thornfield. Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a\r\n",
      "waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered\r\n",
      "in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a\r\n",
      "private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and\r\n",
      "fears are troubling my thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself\r\n",
      "quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain\r\n",
      "whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by\r\n",
      "many impediments from returning to that it has quitted. The charm of\r\n",
      "adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then\r\n",
      "the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when\r\n",
      "half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone. I bethought myself to ring\r\n",
      "the bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?” I asked of\r\n",
      "the waiter who answered the summons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thornfield? I don’t know, ma’am; I’ll inquire at the bar.” He\r\n",
      "vanished, but reappeared instantly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is your name Eyre, Miss?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Person here waiting for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the\r\n",
      "inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit\r\n",
      "street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This will be your luggage, I suppose?” said the man rather abruptly\r\n",
      "when he saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.” He hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and\r\n",
      "then I got in; before he shut me up, I asked him how far it was to\r\n",
      "Thornfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A matter of six miles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Happen an hour and a half.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fastened the car door, climbed to his own seat outside, and we set\r\n",
      "off. Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I\r\n",
      "was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I\r\n",
      "leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I\r\n",
      "meditated much at my ease.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose,” thought I, “judging from the plainness of the servant and\r\n",
      "carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the\r\n",
      "better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very\r\n",
      "miserable with them. I wonder if she lives alone except this little\r\n",
      "girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be\r\n",
      "able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing\r\n",
      "one’s best does not always answer. At Lowood, indeed, I took that\r\n",
      "resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I\r\n",
      "remember my best was always spurned with scorn. I pray God Mrs. Fairfax\r\n",
      "may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to\r\n",
      "stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.\r\n",
      "How far are we on our road now, I wonder?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging\r\n",
      "by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable\r\n",
      "magnitude, much larger than Lowton. We were now, as far as I could see,\r\n",
      "on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the\r\n",
      "district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more\r\n",
      "populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his horse walk\r\n",
      "all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two\r\n",
      "hours; at last he turned in his seat and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re noan so far fro’ Thornfield now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower\r\n",
      "against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow\r\n",
      "galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet. About\r\n",
      "ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we\r\n",
      "passed through, and they clashed to behind us. We now slowly ascended a\r\n",
      "drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed\r\n",
      "from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark. The car stopped\r\n",
      "at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went\r\n",
      "in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you walk this way, ma’am?” said the girl; and I followed her\r\n",
      "across a square hall with high doors all round: she ushered me into a\r\n",
      "room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me,\r\n",
      "contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for\r\n",
      "two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable\r\n",
      "picture presented itself to my view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair\r\n",
      "high-backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable\r\n",
      "little elderly lady, in widow’s cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin\r\n",
      "apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately\r\n",
      "and milder looking. She was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat\r\n",
      "demurely at her feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the\r\n",
      "beau-ideal of domestic comfort. A more reassuring introduction for a\r\n",
      "new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to\r\n",
      "overwhelm, no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old\r\n",
      "lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you do, my dear? I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John\r\n",
      "drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?” said I.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you are right: do sit down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She conducted me to her own chair, and then began to remove my shawl\r\n",
      "and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she would not give herself so\r\n",
      "much trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with\r\n",
      "cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are\r\n",
      "the keys of the storeroom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she produced from her pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and\r\n",
      "delivered them to the servant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,” she continued. “You’ve brought\r\n",
      "your luggage with you, haven’t you, my dear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll see it carried into your room,” she said, and bustled out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She treats me like a visitor,” thought I. “I little expected such a\r\n",
      "reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like\r\n",
      "what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult\r\n",
      "too soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She returned; with her own hands cleared her knitting apparatus and a\r\n",
      "book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now\r\n",
      "brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments. I felt rather\r\n",
      "confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before\r\n",
      "received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she\r\n",
      "did not herself seem to consider she was doing anything out of her\r\n",
      "place, I thought it better to take her civilities quietly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?” I asked,\r\n",
      "when I had partaken of what she offered me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,” returned the good\r\n",
      "lady, approaching her ear to my mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I repeated the question more distinctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your\r\n",
      "future pupil.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed! Then she is not your daughter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,—I have no family.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss\r\n",
      "Varens was connected with her; but I recollected it was not polite to\r\n",
      "ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so glad,” she continued, as she sat down opposite to me, and took\r\n",
      "the cat on her knee; “I am so glad you are come; it will be quite\r\n",
      "pleasant living here now with a companion. To be sure it is pleasant at\r\n",
      "any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late\r\n",
      "years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in\r\n",
      "winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters. I say\r\n",
      "alone—Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very\r\n",
      "decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can’t\r\n",
      "converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due\r\n",
      "distance, for fear of losing one’s authority. I’m sure last winter (it\r\n",
      "was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it\r\n",
      "rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to\r\n",
      "the house, from November till February; and I really got quite\r\n",
      "melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read\r\n",
      "to me sometimes; but I don’t think the poor girl liked the task much:\r\n",
      "she felt it confining. In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine\r\n",
      "and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the\r\n",
      "commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a\r\n",
      "child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be\r\n",
      "quite gay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her talk; and I\r\n",
      "drew my chair a little nearer to her, and expressed my sincere wish\r\n",
      "that she might find my company as agreeable as she anticipated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I’ll not keep you sitting up late to-night,” said she; “it is on\r\n",
      "the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you\r\n",
      "must feel tired. If you have got your feet well warmed, I’ll show you\r\n",
      "your bedroom. I’ve had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is\r\n",
      "only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one\r\n",
      "of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but\r\n",
      "they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thanked her for her considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued\r\n",
      "with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire. She took her\r\n",
      "candle, and I followed her from the room. First she went to see if the\r\n",
      "hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she led the\r\n",
      "way upstairs. The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window\r\n",
      "was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the\r\n",
      "bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than\r\n",
      "a house. A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and\r\n",
      "gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was\r\n",
      "glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small\r\n",
      "dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened\r\n",
      "my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie\r\n",
      "impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase,\r\n",
      "and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room,\r\n",
      "I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I\r\n",
      "was now at last in safe haven. The impulse of gratitude swelled my\r\n",
      "heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where\r\n",
      "thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my\r\n",
      "further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so\r\n",
      "frankly offered me before it was earned. My couch had no thorns in it\r\n",
      "that night; my solitary room no fears. At once weary and content, I\r\n",
      "slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in\r\n",
      "between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and\r\n",
      "a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of\r\n",
      "Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view. Externals have a great effect\r\n",
      "on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me,\r\n",
      "one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns\r\n",
      "and toils. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field\r\n",
      "offered to hope, seemed all astir. I cannot precisely define what they\r\n",
      "expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that\r\n",
      "month, but at an indefinite future period.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain—for I had no\r\n",
      "article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity—I was still\r\n",
      "by nature solicitous to be neat. It was not my habit to be disregardful\r\n",
      "of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I\r\n",
      "ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my\r\n",
      "want of beauty would permit. I sometimes regretted that I was not\r\n",
      "handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and\r\n",
      "small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed\r\n",
      "in figure; I felt it a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and\r\n",
      "had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these\r\n",
      "aspirations and these regrets? It would be difficult to say: I could\r\n",
      "not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a\r\n",
      "logical, natural reason too. However, when I had brushed my hair very\r\n",
      "smooth, and put on my black frock—which, Quakerlike as it was, at least\r\n",
      "had the merit of fitting to a nicety—and adjusted my clean white\r\n",
      "tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with\r\n",
      "antipathy. Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all\r\n",
      "things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps\r\n",
      "of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at\r\n",
      "some pictures on the walls (one, I remember, represented a grim man in\r\n",
      "a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace), at\r\n",
      "a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was\r\n",
      "of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.\r\n",
      "Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so\r\n",
      "little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass,\r\n",
      "stood open; I stepped over the threshold. It was a fine autumn morning;\r\n",
      "the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green\r\n",
      "fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of\r\n",
      "the mansion. It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though\r\n",
      "considerable: a gentleman’s manor-house, not a nobleman’s seat:\r\n",
      "battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look. Its grey front\r\n",
      "stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants\r\n",
      "were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in\r\n",
      "a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and\r\n",
      "where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as\r\n",
      "oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion’s designation.\r\n",
      "Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so\r\n",
      "craggy, nor so like barriers of separation from the living world; but\r\n",
      "yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield\r\n",
      "with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the\r\n",
      "stirring locality of Millcote. A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent\r\n",
      "with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of\r\n",
      "the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a\r\n",
      "knoll between the house and gates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet\r\n",
      "listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the\r\n",
      "wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was\r\n",
      "for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady\r\n",
      "appeared at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! out already?” said she. “I see you are an early riser.” I went\r\n",
      "up to her, and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you like Thornfield?” she asked. I told her I liked it very\r\n",
      "much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” she said, “it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting\r\n",
      "out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come\r\n",
      "and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener:\r\n",
      "great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester!” I exclaimed. “Who is he?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The owner of Thornfield,” she responded quietly. “Did you not know he\r\n",
      "was called Rochester?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course I did not—I had never heard of him before; but the old lady\r\n",
      "seemed to regard his existence as a universally understood fact, with\r\n",
      "which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought,” I continued, “Thornfield belonged to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the\r\n",
      "housekeeper—the manager. To be sure I am distantly related to the\r\n",
      "Rochesters by the mother’s side, or at least my husband was; he was a\r\n",
      "clergyman, incumbent of Hay—that little village yonder on the hill—and\r\n",
      "that church near the gates was his. The present Mr. Rochester’s mother\r\n",
      "was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on\r\n",
      "the connection—in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in\r\n",
      "the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and\r\n",
      "I expect nothing more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the little girl—my pupil!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is Mr. Rochester’s ward; he commissioned me to find a governess\r\n",
      "for her. He intended to have her brought up in ——shire, I believe. Here\r\n",
      "she comes, with her ‘bonne,’ as she calls her nurse.” The enigma then\r\n",
      "was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame;\r\n",
      "but a dependent like myself. I did not like her the worse for that; on\r\n",
      "the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. The equality between her\r\n",
      "and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her part: so\r\n",
      "much the better—my position was all the freer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her\r\n",
      "attendant, came running up the lawn. I looked at my pupil, who did not\r\n",
      "at first appear to notice me: she was quite a child, perhaps seven or\r\n",
      "eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and\r\n",
      "a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her waist.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good morning, Miss Adela,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Come and speak to the\r\n",
      "lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.” She\r\n",
      "approached.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“C’est là ma gouvernante!” said she, pointing to me, and addressing her\r\n",
      "nurse; who answered—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mais oui, certainement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are they foreigners?” I inquired, amazed at hearing the French\r\n",
      "language.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I\r\n",
      "believe, never left it till within six months ago. When she first came\r\n",
      "here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a\r\n",
      "little: I don’t understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you\r\n",
      "will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French\r\n",
      "lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame\r\n",
      "Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven\r\n",
      "years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily—applying myself to\r\n",
      "take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the\r\n",
      "pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of\r\n",
      "readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be\r\n",
      "much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela. She came and shook hands with\r\n",
      "me when she heard that I was her governess; and as I led her in to\r\n",
      "breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue: she\r\n",
      "replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and\r\n",
      "she had examined me some ten minutes with her large hazel eyes, she\r\n",
      "suddenly commenced chattering fluently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah!” cried she, in French, “you speak my language as well as Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.\r\n",
      "She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all\r\n",
      "English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great\r\n",
      "ship with a chimney that smoked—how it did smoke!—and I was sick, and\r\n",
      "so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a\r\n",
      "sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little\r\n",
      "beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.\r\n",
      "And Mademoiselle—what is your name?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eyre—Jane Eyre.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. Well, our ship stopped in the morning,\r\n",
      "before it was quite daylight, at a great city—a huge city, with very\r\n",
      "dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came\r\n",
      "from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the\r\n",
      "land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us\r\n",
      "to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an\r\n",
      "hotel. We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every\r\n",
      "day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there\r\n",
      "were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in\r\n",
      "it, that I fed with crumbs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?” asked Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I understood her very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent\r\n",
      "tongue of Madame Pierrot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish,” continued the good lady, “you would ask her a question or two\r\n",
      "about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Adèle,” I inquired, “with whom did you live when you were in that\r\n",
      "pretty clean town you spoke of?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama\r\n",
      "used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses. A great many\r\n",
      "gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them,\r\n",
      "or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it. Shall I let you\r\n",
      "hear me sing now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had finished her breakfast, so I permitted her to give a specimen\r\n",
      "of her accomplishments. Descending from her chair, she came and placed\r\n",
      "herself on my knee; then, folding her little hands demurely before her,\r\n",
      "shaking back her curls and lifting her eyes to the ceiling, she\r\n",
      "commenced singing a song from some opera. It was the strain of a\r\n",
      "forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her lover, calls\r\n",
      "pride to her aid; desires her attendant to deck her in her brightest\r\n",
      "jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night\r\n",

      "The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose\r\n",
      "the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and\r\n",

      "of gesture, very unusual indeed at her age, and which proved she had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“With Madame Frédéric and her husband: she took care of me, but she is\r\n",
      "nothing related to me. I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a\r\n",
      "house as mama. I was not long there. Mr. Rochester asked me if I would\r\n",
      "like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester before I knew Madame Frédéric, and he was always kind to me\r\n",

      "way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature,\r\n",
      "poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c. I suppose he had\r\n",

      "compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean\r\n",
      "at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment\r\n",
      "and information. In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite\r\n",

      "globes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she\r\n",
      "had not been used to regular occupation of any kind. I felt it would be\r\n",
      "injudicious to confine her too much at first; so, when I had talked to\r\n",
      "her a great deal, and got her to learn a little, and when the morning\r\n",
      "had advanced to noon, I allowed her to return to her nurse. I then\r\n",

      "she. She was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in\r\n",

      "chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast\r\n",
      "window rich in stained glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded. Mrs.\r\n",

      "sideboard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a beautiful room!” I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had\r\n",
      "never before seen any half so imposing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; this is the dining-room. I have just opened the window, to let in\r\n",
      "a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments\r\n",
      "that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like\r\n",
      "it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up. Mounting to it by two\r\n",
      "broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a\r\n",
      "fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond. Yet\r\n",
      "it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both\r\n",
      "spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of\r\n",
      "flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and\r\n",
      "vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and\r\n",
      "ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of\r\n",
      "sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester’s visits here are rare, they are\r\n",
      "always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to\r\n",
      "find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his\r\n",
      "arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Do you like him? Is he generally liked?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. Almost all the\r\n",
      "land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“_I_ have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“But has he no peculiarities? What, in short, is his character?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose. He is rather peculiar,\r\n",
      "perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the\r\n",
      "world, I should think. I dare say he is clever, but I never had much\r\n",
      "conversation with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In what way is he peculiar?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know—it is not easy to describe—nothing striking, but you feel\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and\r\n",
      "mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a\r\n",
      "character, or observing and describing salient points, either in\r\n",
      "persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my\r\n",
      "queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester in her eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor—nothing more:\r\n",
      "she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish\r\n",
      "to gain a more definite notion of his identity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we left the dining-room, she proposed to show me over the rest of\r\n",
      "the house; and I followed her upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I\r\n",
      "went; for all was well arranged and handsome. The large front chambers\r\n",
      "I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though\r\n",
      "dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity. The\r\n",
      "furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to\r\n",
      "time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light\r\n",
      "entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years\r\n",
      "old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of\r\n",
      "palm branches and cherubs’ heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of\r\n",
      "venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated,\r\n",
      "on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced\r\n",
      "embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been\r\n",
      "coffin-dust. All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield\r\n",
      "Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory. I liked the\r\n",
      "hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by\r\n",
      "no means coveted a night’s repose on one of those wide and heavy beds:\r\n",
      "shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought\r\n",
      "old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of\r\n",
      "strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,—all\r\n",
      "which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of\r\n",
      "moonlight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do the servants sleep in these rooms?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever\r\n",
      "sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at\r\n",
      "Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So I think: you have no ghost, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“None that I ever heard of,” returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe not. And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a\r\n",
      "violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the\r\n",
      "reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—‘after life’s fitful fever they sleep well,’” I muttered. “Where\r\n",
      "are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?” for she was moving away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?” I\r\n",
      "followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by\r\n",
      "a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall. I was now on\r\n",
      "a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. Leaning\r\n",
      "over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid\r\n",
      "out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey\r\n",
      "base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient\r\n",
      "timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown,\r\n",
      "greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the\r\n",
      "gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day’s\r\n",
      "sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with\r\n",
      "pearly white. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was\r\n",
      "pleasing. When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could\r\n",
      "scarcely see my way down the ladder; the attic seemed black as a vault\r\n",
      "compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and\r\n",
      "to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the\r\n",
      "hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by dint\r\n",
      "of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend\r\n",
      "the narrow garret staircase. I lingered in the long passage to which\r\n",
      "this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey:\r\n",
      "narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and\r\n",
      "looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a\r\n",
      "corridor in some Bluebeard’s castle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still\r\n",
      "a region, a laugh, struck my ear. It was a curious laugh; distinct,\r\n",
      "formal, mirthless. I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it\r\n",
      "began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low. It\r\n",
      "passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every\r\n",
      "lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have\r\n",
      "pointed out the door whence the accents issued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Fairfax!” I called out: for I now heard her descending the great\r\n",
      "stairs. “Did you hear that loud laugh? Who is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some of the servants, very likely,” she answered: “perhaps Grace\r\n",
      "Poole.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you hear it?” I again inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms.\r\n",
      "Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an\r\n",
      "odd murmur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Grace!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as\r\n",
      "tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it\r\n",
      "was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the\r\n",
      "curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear,\r\n",
      "I should have been superstitiously afraid. However, the event showed me\r\n",
      "I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,—a woman of between\r\n",
      "thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a\r\n",
      "hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could\r\n",
      "scarcely be conceived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Too much noise, Grace,” said Mrs. Fairfax. “Remember directions!”\r\n",
      "Grace curtseyed silently and went in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid’s\r\n",
      "work,” continued the widow; “not altogether unobjectionable in some\r\n",
      "points, but she does well enough. By-the-bye, how have you got on with\r\n",
      "your new pupil this morning?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation, thus turned on Adèle, continued till we reached the\r\n",
      "light and cheerful region below. Adèle came running to meet us in the\r\n",
      "hall, exclaiming—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mesdames, vous êtes servies!” adding, “J’ai bien faim, moi!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to\r\n",
      "Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer\r\n",
      "acquaintance with the place and its inmates. Mrs. Fairfax turned out to\r\n",
      "be what she appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of\r\n",
      "competent education and average intelligence. My pupil was a lively\r\n",
      "child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes\r\n",
      "wayward; but as she was committed entirely to my care, and no\r\n",
      "injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for\r\n",
      "her improvement, she soon forgot her little freaks, and became obedient\r\n",
      "and teachable. She had no great talents, no marked traits of character,\r\n",
      "no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her one inch\r\n",
      "above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she any\r\n",
      "deficiency or vice which sunk her below it. She made reasonable\r\n",
      "progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very\r\n",
      "profound, affection; and by her simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to\r\n",
      "please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient\r\n",
      "to make us both content in each other’s society.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This, _par parenthèse_, will be thought cool language by persons who\r\n",
      "entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and\r\n",
      "the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an\r\n",
      "idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism,\r\n",
      "to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth. I felt\r\n",
      "a conscientious solicitude for Adèle’s welfare and progress, and a\r\n",
      "quiet liking for her little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax a thankfulness for her kindness, and a pleasure in her society\r\n",
      "proportionate to the tranquil regard she had for me, and the moderation\r\n",
      "of her mind and character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then,\r\n",
      "when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the\r\n",
      "gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adèle\r\n",
      "played with her nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom,\r\n",
      "I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and\r\n",
      "having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and\r\n",
      "hill, and along dim sky-line—that then I longed for a power of vision\r\n",
      "which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world,\r\n",
      "towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen—that then I\r\n",
      "desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of\r\n",
      "intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character,\r\n",
      "than was here within my reach. I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax,\r\n",
      "and what was good in Adèle; but I believed in the existence of other\r\n",
      "and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to\r\n",
      "behold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I\r\n",
      "could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to\r\n",
      "pain sometimes. Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of\r\n",
      "the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and\r\n",
      "solitude of the spot, and allow my mind’s eye to dwell on whatever\r\n",
      "bright visions rose before it—and, certainly, they were many and\r\n",
      "glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which,\r\n",
      "while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of\r\n",
      "all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended—a tale my\r\n",

      "as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged\r\n",
      "fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making\r\n",
      "puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and\r\n",

      "fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the\r\n",
      "species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation. It was\r\n",
      "three o’clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the\r\n",
      "charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding\r\n",
      "and pale-beaming sun. I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for\r\n",
      "wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now\r\n",
      "possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best\r\n",
      "winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose. If a\r\n",
      "breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a\r\n",
      "holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel\r\n",
      "bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the\r\n",
      "middle of the path. Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields,\r\n",
      "where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred\r\n",
      "occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had\r\n",
      "forgotten to drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the\r\n",
      "middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field. Gathering\r\n",
      "my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel\r\n",
      "the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice\r\n",
      "covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had\r\n",
      "overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since. From my seat I could\r\n",
      "look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the\r\n",
      "principal object in the vale below me; its woods and dark rookery rose\r\n",
      "against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees,\r\n",
      "and sank crimson and clear behind them. I then turned eastward.\r\n",

      "On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but\r\n",
      "brightening momentarily, she looked over Hay, which, half lost in\r\n",
      "trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys: it was yet a mile\r\n",
      "distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs\r\n",
      "of life. My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and\r\n",
      "depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and\r\n",
      "doubtless many becks threading their passes. That evening calm betrayed\r\n",
      "alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so\r\n",
      "far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter,\r\n",
      "which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid\r\n",
      "mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and\r\n",
      "strong on the foreground, efface the aërial distance of azure hill,\r\n",
      "sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the\r\n",
      "lane yet hid it, but it approached. I was just leaving the stile; yet,\r\n",
      "as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by. In those days I\r\n",
      "was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind:\r\n",
      "the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and\r\n",
      "when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness\r\n",
      "beyond what childhood could give. As this horse approached, and as I\r\n",
      "watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of\r\n",
      "Bessie’s tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a\r\n",
      "“Gytrash,” which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted\r\n",
      "solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this\r\n",
      "horse was now coming upon me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp,\r\n",
      "tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel\r\n",
      "stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him a\r\n",
      "distinct object against the trees. It was exactly one form of Bessie’s\r\n",
      "Gytrash—a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed\r\n",
      "me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange\r\n",
      "pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would. The horse\r\n",
      "followed,—a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human\r\n",
      "being, broke the spell at once. Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was\r\n",
      "always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the\r\n",
      "dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace\r\n",
      "human form. No Gytrash was this,—only a traveller taking the short cut\r\n",
      "to Millcote. He passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a\r\n",
      "sliding sound and an exclamation of “What the deuce is to do now?” and\r\n",
      "a clattering tumble, arrested my attention. Man and horse were down;\r\n",
      "they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway. The dog\r\n",
      "came bounding back, and seeing his master in a predicament, and hearing\r\n",
      "the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which\r\n",
      "was deep in proportion to his magnitude. He snuffed round the prostrate\r\n",
      "group, and then he ran up to me; it was all he could do,—there was no\r\n",
      "other help at hand to summon. I obeyed him, and walked down to the\r\n",
      "traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his steed. His\r\n",
      "efforts were so vigorous, I thought he could not be much hurt; but I\r\n",
      "asked him the question—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you injured, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think he was swearing, but am not certain; however, he was\r\n",
      "pronouncing some formula which prevented him from replying to me\r\n",
      "directly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can I do anything?” I asked again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must just stand on one side,” he answered as he rose, first to his\r\n",
      "knees, and then to his feet. I did; whereupon began a heaving,\r\n",
      "stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which\r\n",
      "removed me effectually some yards’ distance; but I would not be driven\r\n",
      "quite away till I saw the event. This was finally fortunate; the horse\r\n",
      "was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a “Down, Pilot!” The\r\n",
      "traveller now, stooping, felt his foot and leg, as if trying whether\r\n",
      "they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he halted to the\r\n",
      "stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for\r\n",
      "I now drew near him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from\r\n",
      "Thornfield Hall or from Hay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,—only a sprain;” and\r\n",
      "again he stood up and tried his foot, but the result extorted an\r\n",
      "involuntary “Ugh!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I\r\n",
      "could see him plainly. His figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur\r\n",
      "collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced\r\n",
      "the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.\r\n",
      "He had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his eyes and\r\n",
      "gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he was past\r\n",
      "youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he might be thirty-five.\r\n",
      "I felt no fear of him, and but little shyness. Had he been a handsome,\r\n",
      "heroic-looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus\r\n",
      "questioning him against his will, and offering my services unasked. I\r\n",
      "had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.\r\n",
      "I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance,\r\n",
      "gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in\r\n",
      "masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither\r\n",
      "had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have\r\n",
      "shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is\r\n",
      "bright but antipathetic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I\r\n",
      "addressed him; if he had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with\r\n",
      "thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew\r\n",
      "inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my\r\n",
      "ease: I retained my station when he waved to me to go, and announced—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this\r\n",
      "solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.”\r\n",

      "direction before.\r\n",

      "it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You live just below—do you mean at that house with the battlements?”\r\n",
      "pointing to Thornfield Hall, on which the moon cast a hoary gleam,\r\n",
      "bringing it out distinct and pale from the woods that, by contrast with\r\n",
      "the western sky, now seemed one mass of shadow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You are not a servant at the hall, of course. You are—” He stopped,\r\n",
      "ran his eye over my dress, which, as usual, was quite simple: a black\r\n",
      "merino cloak, a black beaver bonnet; neither of them half fine enough\r\n",
      "for a lady’s-maid. He seemed puzzled to decide what I was; I helped\r\n",

      "tried to move.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I should have been afraid to touch a horse when alone, but when told to\r\n",

      "went up to the tall steed; I endeavoured to catch the bridle, but it\r\n",
      "was a spirited thing, and would not let me come near its head; I made\r\n",
      "effort on effort, though in vain: meantime, I was mortally afraid of\r\n",
      "its trampling fore-feet. The traveller waited and watched for some\r\n",
      "time, and at last he laughed.\r\n",

      "new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of\r\n",
      "memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly,\r\n",
      "because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong,\r\n",
      "and stern. I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the\r\n",
      "letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all\r\n",

      "round and listened, with an idea that a horse’s hoofs might ring on the\r\n",
      "causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like\r\n",
      "Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a\r\n",
      "pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the\r\n",
      "moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among\r\n",

      "the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I did not like re-entering Thornfield. To pass its threshold was to\r\n",

      "Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her, and her only,\r\n",
      "was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,—to slip\r\n",
      "again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too\r\n",
      "still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and\r\n",
      "ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating. What good it would have\r\n",
      "done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain\r\n",
      "struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience\r\n",

      "which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adèle, when the door closed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax’s room; there was a fire there too, but no\r\n",
      "candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax. Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the\r\n",
      "rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and\r\n",
      "white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane. It was so\r\n",
      "like it that I went forward and said—“Pilot,” and the thing got up and\r\n",
      "came to me and snuffed me. I caressed him, and he wagged his great\r\n",
      "tail; but he looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not\r\n",
      "tell whence he had come. I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I\r\n",
      "wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What dog is this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He came with master.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With whom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With master—Mr. Rochester—he is just arrived.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and Miss Adèle; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for\r\n",
      "a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle\r\n",
      "is sprained.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leah brought it; she entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated\r\n",
      "the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester: then she hurried out to give orders about tea, and I\r\n",
      "went upstairs to take off my things.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon’s orders, went to bed early\r\n",
      "that night; nor did he rise soon next morning. When he did come down,\r\n",
      "it was to attend to business: his agent and some of his tenants were\r\n",
      "arrived, and waiting to speak with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily\r\n",
      "requisition as a reception-room for callers. A fire was lit in an\r\n",
      "apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for\r\n",
      "the future schoolroom. I discerned in the course of the morning that\r\n",
      "Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it\r\n",
      "echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the\r\n",
      "bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in\r\n",
      "different keys below; a rill from the outer world was flowing through\r\n",
      "it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle was not easy to teach that day; she could not apply: she kept\r\n",
      "running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she could\r\n",
      "get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she coined pretexts to go\r\n",
      "downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library,\r\n",
      "where I knew she was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and\r\n",
      "made her sit still, she continued to talk incessantly of her “ami,\r\n",
      "Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester,” as she dubbed him (I had not\r\n",
      "before heard his prenomens), and to conjecture what presents he had\r\n",
      "brought her: for it appears he had intimated the night before, that\r\n",
      "when his luggage came from Millcote, there would be found amongst it a\r\n",
      "little box in whose contents she had an interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Et cela doit signifier,” said she, “qu’il y aura là dedans un cadeau\r\n",
      "pour moi, et peut-être pour vous aussi, mademoiselle. Monsieur a parlé\r\n",
      "de vous: il m’a demandé le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n’était\r\n",
      "pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pâle. J’ai dit qu’oui:\r\n",
      "car c’est vrai, n’est-ce pas, mademoiselle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax’s parlour; the afternoon\r\n",
      "was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom. At dark I\r\n",
      "allowed Adèle to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for,\r\n",
      "from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals\r\n",
      "to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.\r\n",
      "Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence:\r\n",
      "twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very\r\n",
      "shrubs on the lawn. I let down the curtain and went back to the\r\n",
      "fireside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the clear embers I was tracing a view, not unlike a picture I\r\n",
      "remembered to have seen of the castle of Heidelberg, on the Rhine, when\r\n",
      "Mrs. Fairfax came in, breaking up by her entrance the fiery mosaic I\r\n",
      "had been piercing together, and scattering too some heavy unwelcome\r\n",
      "thoughts that were beginning to throng on my solitude.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with\r\n",
      "him in the drawing-room this evening,” said she: “he has been so much\r\n",
      "engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When is his tea-time?” I inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, at six o’clock: he keeps early hours in the country. You had\r\n",
      "better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it. Here is\r\n",
      "a candle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it necessary to change my frock?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "is here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired\r\n",
      "to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax’s aid, replaced my black stuff dress\r\n",
      "by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had,\r\n",
      "except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette,\r\n",
      "I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You want a brooch,” said Mrs. Fairfax. I had a single little pearl\r\n",
      "ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on,\r\n",
      "and then we went downstairs. Unused as I was to strangers, it was\r\n",
      "rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester’s\r\n",
      "presence. I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept\r\n",
      "in her shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose\r\n",
      "curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece;\r\n",
      "basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot—Adèle knelt\r\n",
      "near him. Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his foot\r\n",
      "supported by the cushion; he was looking at Adèle and the dog: the fire\r\n",
      "shone full on his face. I knew my traveller with his broad and jetty\r\n",
      "eyebrows; his square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of\r\n",
      "his black hair. I recognised his decisive nose, more remarkable for\r\n",
      "character than beauty; his full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler;\r\n",
      "his grim mouth, chin, and jaw—yes, all three were very grim, and no\r\n",
      "mistake. His shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in\r\n",
      "squareness with his physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the\r\n",
      "athletic sense of the term—broad chested and thin flanked, though\r\n",
      "neither tall nor graceful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and\r\n",
      "myself; but it appeared he was not in the mood to notice us, for he\r\n",
      "never lifted his head as we approached.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here is Miss Eyre, sir,” said Mrs. Fairfax, in her quiet way. He\r\n",
      "bowed, still not taking his eyes from the group of the dog and child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let Miss Eyre be seated,” said he: and there was something in the\r\n",
      "forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed\r\n",
      "further to express, “What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be\r\n",
      "there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down quite disembarrassed. A reception of finished politeness\r\n",
      "would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it\r\n",
      "by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me\r\n",
      "under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the\r\n",
      "freak of manner, gave me the advantage. Besides, the eccentricity of\r\n",
      "the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he would go\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went on as a statue would, that is, he neither spoke nor moved. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable,\r\n",
      "and she began to talk. Kindly, as usual—and, as usual, rather trite—she\r\n",
      "condoled with him on the pressure of business he had had all day; on\r\n",
      "the annoyance it must have been to him with that painful sprain: then\r\n",
      "she commended his patience and perseverance in going through with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, I should like some tea,” was the sole rejoinder she got. She\r\n",
      "hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she proceeded to\r\n",
      "arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity. I and Adèle\r\n",
      "went to the table; but the master did not leave his couch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you hand Mr. Rochester’s cup?” said Mrs. Fairfax to me; “Adèle\r\n",
      "might perhaps spill it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did as requested. As he took the cup from my hand, Adèle, thinking\r\n",
      "the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N’est-ce pas, monsieur, qu’il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre\r\n",
      "dans votre petit coffre?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who talks of cadeaux?” said he gruffly. “Did you expect a present,\r\n",
      "Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?” and he searched my face with eyes\r\n",
      "that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are\r\n",
      "generally thought pleasant things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Generally thought? But what do _you_ think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an\r\n",
      "answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has\r\n",
      "it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as\r\n",
      "to its nature.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adèle: she demands a\r\n",
      "‘cadeau,’ clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the\r\n",
      "bush.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adèle has: she can\r\n",
      "prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for\r\n",
      "she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings;\r\n",
      "but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a\r\n",
      "stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t fall back on over-modesty! I have examined Adèle, and find\r\n",
      "you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no\r\n",
      "talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir, you have now given me my ‘cadeau;’ I am obliged to you: it is the\r\n",
      "meed teachers most covet—praise of their pupils’ progress.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Humph!” said Mr. Rochester, and he took his tea in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come to the fire,” said the master, when the tray was taken away, and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her knitting; while Adèle\r\n",
      "was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful\r\n",
      "books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnières. We obeyed, as in\r\n",
      "duty bound; Adèle wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she was ordered\r\n",
      "to amuse herself with Pilot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have been resident in my house three months?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you came from—?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From Lowood school, in ——shire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eight years.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eight years! you must be tenacious of life. I thought half the time in\r\n",
      "such a place would have done up any constitution! No wonder you have\r\n",
      "rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that\r\n",
      "sort of face. When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought\r\n",
      "unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you\r\n",
      "had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet. Who are your parents?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have none.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought not. And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on\r\n",
      "that stile?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For whom, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them. Did\r\n",
      "I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on\r\n",
      "the causeway?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shook my head. “The men in green all forsook England a hundred years\r\n",
      "ago,” said I, speaking as seriously as he had done. “And not even in\r\n",
      "Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I\r\n",
      "don’t think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine\r\n",
      "on their revels more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her knitting, and, with raised eyebrows,\r\n",
      "seemed wondering what sort of talk this was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” resumed Mr. Rochester, “if you disown parents, you must have\r\n",
      "some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; none that I ever saw.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your home?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have none.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where do your brothers and sisters live?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no brothers or sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who recommended you to come here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said the good lady, who now knew what ground we were upon, “and\r\n",
      "I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make. Miss Eyre\r\n",
      "has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher\r\n",
      "to Adèle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t trouble yourself to give her a character,” returned Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester: “eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself. She\r\n",
      "began by felling my horse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir?” said Mrs. Fairfax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have to thank her for this sprain.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The widow looked bewildered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you seen much society?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of\r\n",
      "Thornfield.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you read much?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or\r\n",
      "very learned.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in\r\n",
      "religious forms;—Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a\r\n",
      "parson, is he not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of\r\n",
      "religieuses would worship their director.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her priest! That\r\n",
      "sounds blasphemous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling. He is\r\n",
      "a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for\r\n",
      "economy’s sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could\r\n",
      "hardly sew.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was very false economy,” remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again\r\n",
      "caught the drift of the dialogue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And was that the head and front of his offending?” demanded Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision\r\n",
      "department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with\r\n",
      "long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his\r\n",
      "own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid\r\n",
      "to go to bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What age were you when you went to Lowood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“About ten.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I assented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have\r\n",
      "been able to guess your age. It is a point difficult to fix where the\r\n",
      "features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case. And\r\n",
      "now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course: that is the established answer. Go into the library—I mean,\r\n",
      "if you please.—(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, ‘Do this,’\r\n",
      "and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new\r\n",
      "inmate.)—Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the\r\n",
      "door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I departed, obeying his directions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough!” he called out in a few minutes. “You play _a little_, I see;\r\n",
      "like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some,\r\n",
      "but not well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued—\r\n",

      "would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a\r\n",
      "pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These pictures were in water-colours. The first represented clouds low\r\n",
      "and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse;\r\n",
      "so, too, was the foreground; or rather, the nearest billows, for there\r\n",
      "was no land. One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged\r\n",
      "mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with\r\n",
      "foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched\r\n",
      "with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering\r\n",
      "distinctness as my pencil could impart. Sinking below the bird and\r\n",
      "mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was\r\n",

      "above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into\r\n",
      "the sky was a woman’s shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and\r\n",
      "soft as I could combine. The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the\r\n",
      "lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes\r\n",
      "shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud\r\n",
      "torn by storm or by electric travail. On the neck lay a pale reflection\r\n",
      "like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds\r\n",
      "from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter\r\n",
      "sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close\r\n",
      "serried, along the horizon. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the\r\n",
      "foreground, a head,—a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and\r\n",
      "resting against it. Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and\r\n",
      "supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil; a brow\r\n",
      "quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of\r\n",
      "meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible. Above\r\n",
      "the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in\r\n",
      "its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame,\r\n",
      "gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge. This pale crescent was “the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That is not saying much. Your pleasures, by your own account, have\r\n",
      "been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist’s dreamland\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar. As to\r\n",
      "the thoughts, they are elfish. These eyes in the Evening Star you must\r\n",
      "have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet\r\n",
      "not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays. And what\r\n",
      "meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint\r\n",
      "wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did\r\n",

      "so much.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish you all good-night, now,” said he, making a movement of the\r\n",
      "hand towards the door, in token that he was tired of our company, and\r\n",
      "wished to dismiss us. Mrs. Fairfax folded up her knitting: I took my\r\n",
      "portfolio: we curtseyed to him, received a frigid bow in return, and so\r\n",
      "withdrew.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed\r\n",
      "to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities\r\n",
      "of temper, allowance should be made.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Partly because it is his nature—and we can none of us help our nature;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“His _elder_ brother?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the property; only about nine years.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he so very fond of his brother as\r\n",
      "to be still inconsolable for his loss?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, no—perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings\r\n",
      "between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward;\r\n",
      "and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him. The old gentleman was\r\n",
      "fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. He did\r\n",
      "not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious\r\n",
      "that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of\r\n",
      "the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that\r\n",
      "were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief. Old Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he\r\n",
      "considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what\r\n",
      "the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his\r\n",
      "spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it. He is not very\r\n",
      "forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led\r\n",
      "an unsettled kind of life. I don’t think he has ever been resident at\r\n",
      "Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother\r\n",
      "without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "The answer was evasive. I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit\r\n",
      "information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester’s trials. She\r\n",
      "averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she knew was\r\n",

      "For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester. In the\r\n",
      "mornings he seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon,\r\n",
      "gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes\r\n",
      "stayed to dine with him. When his sprain was well enough to admit of\r\n",
      "horse exercise, he rode out a good deal; probably to return these\r\n",
      "visits, as he generally did not come back till late at night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During this interval, even Adèle was seldom sent for to his presence,\r\n",
      "and all my acquaintance with him was confined to an occasional\r\n",
      "rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he would\r\n",
      "sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence\r\n",
      "by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with\r\n",
      "gentlemanlike affability. His changes of mood did not offend me,\r\n",
      "because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb\r\n",
      "and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day he had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in\r\n",
      "order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away\r\n",
      "early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed\r\n",
      "me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not\r\n",
      "accompany them. Soon after they were gone he rang the bell: a message\r\n",
      "came that I and Adèle were to go downstairs. I brushed Adèle’s hair and\r\n",
      "made her neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual\r\n",
      "Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch—all being too close and\r\n",
      "plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement—we descended,\r\n",
      "Adèle wondering whether the _petit coffre_ was at length come; for,\r\n",
      "owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed. She was\r\n",
      "gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we\r\n",
      "entered the dining-room. She appeared to know it by instinct.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ma boite! ma boite!” exclaimed she, running towards it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, there is your ‘boite’ at last: take it into a corner, you genuine\r\n",
      "daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,” said the\r\n",
      "deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the\r\n",
      "depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside. “And mind,” he\r\n",
      "continued, “don’t bother me with any details of the anatomical process,\r\n",
      "or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be\r\n",
      "conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle seemed scarcely to need the warning; she had already retired to a\r\n",
      "sofa with her treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the\r\n",
      "lid. Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery\r\n",
      "envelopes of tissue paper, she merely exclaimed—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh ciel! Que c’est beau!” and then remained absorbed in ecstatic\r\n",
      "contemplation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is Miss Eyre there?” now demanded the master, half rising from his\r\n",
      "seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.” He drew a chair near his own.\r\n",
      "“I am not fond of the prattle of children,” he continued; “for, old\r\n",
      "bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their\r\n",
      "lisp. It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening\r\n",
      "_tête-à-tête_ with a brat. Don’t draw that chair farther off, Miss\r\n",
      "Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it—if you please, that is.\r\n",
      "Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I\r\n",
      "particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. By-the-bye, I must have\r\n",
      "mine in mind; it won’t do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to\r\n",
      "one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon\r\n",
      "arrived, knitting-basket in hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. I have\r\n",
      "forbidden Adèle to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting\r\n",
      "with repletion; have the goodness to serve her as auditress and\r\n",
      "interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever\r\n",
      "performed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she summoned her to her\r\n",
      "sofa, and there quickly filled her lap with the porcelain, the ivory,\r\n",
      "the waxen contents of her “boite;” pouring out, meantime, explanations\r\n",
      "and raptures in such broken English as she was mistress of.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now I have performed the part of a good host,” pursued Mr. Rochester,\r\n",
      "“put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at\r\n",
      "liberty to attend to my own pleasure. Miss Eyre, draw your chair still\r\n",
      "a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you\r\n",
      "without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have\r\n",
      "no mind to do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat\r\n",
      "in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders,\r\n",
      "it seemed a matter of course to obey him promptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been\r\n",
      "lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the\r\n",
      "large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and\r\n",
      "ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still,\r\n",
      "save the subdued chat of Adèle (she dared not speak loud), and, filling\r\n",
      "up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester, as he sat in his damask-covered chair, looked different\r\n",
      "to what I had seen him look before; not quite so stern—much less\r\n",
      "gloomy. There was a smile on his lips, and his eyes sparkled, whether\r\n",
      "with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable. He was,\r\n",
      "in short, in his after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also\r\n",
      "more self-indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning;\r\n",
      "still he looked preciously grim, cushioning his massive head against\r\n",
      "the swelling back of his chair, and receiving the light of the fire on\r\n",
      "his granite-hewn features, and in his great, dark eyes; for he had\r\n",
      "great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too—not without a certain change\r\n",
      "in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you,\r\n",
      "at least, of that feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the\r\n",
      "same length of time at him, when, turning suddenly, he caught my gaze\r\n",
      "fastened on his physiognomy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You examine me, Miss Eyre,” said he: “do you think me handsome?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by\r\n",
      "something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow\r\n",
      "slipped from my tongue before I was aware—“No, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! By my word! there is something singular about you,” said he: “you\r\n",
      "have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple,\r\n",
      "as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on\r\n",
      "the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my\r\n",
      "face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or\r\n",
      "makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round\r\n",
      "rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque. What do you mean\r\n",
      "by it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. I ought to have replied that\r\n",
      "it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about\r\n",
      "appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little\r\n",
      "consequence, or something of that sort.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence,\r\n",
      "indeed! And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of\r\n",
      "stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under\r\n",
      "my ear! Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have\r\n",

      "while she played with Pilot and her shuttlecock, he asked me to walk up\r\n",

      "destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to\r\n",
      "deviate an inch from the beaten centre. I had—as I deserved to have—the\r\n",
      "fate of all other spoonies. Happening to call one evening when Céline\r\n",
      "did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was\r\n",
      "tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy\r\n",
      "to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence. No,—I\r\n",
      "exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about\r\n",
      "her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of\r\n",
      "musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity. I was just beginning to\r\n",
      "stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences,\r\n",
      "when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the\r\n",
      "balcony. It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and\r\n",
      "serene. The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and\r\n",
      "took out a cigar,—I will take one now, if you will excuse me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was\r\n",
      "_croquant_—(overlook the barbarism)—_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and\r\n",
      "smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along\r\n",
      "the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in\r\n",
      "an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses,\r\n",
      "and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the\r\n",
      "‘voiture’ I had given Céline. She was returning: of course my heart\r\n",
      "thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. The\r\n",
      "carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that\r\n",

      "cloak—an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June\r\n",
      "evening—I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the\r\n",
      "skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step. Bending over\r\n",
      "the balcony, I was about to murmur ‘Mon ange’—in a tone, of course,\r\n",
      "which should be audible to the ear of love alone—when a figure jumped\r\n",
      "from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel\r\n",
      "which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now\r\n",
      "passed under the arched _porte cochère_ of the hotel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not\r\n",

      "experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall\r\n",
      "waken it. You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in\r\n",
      "which your youth has hitherto slid away. Floating on with closed eyes\r\n",

      "tell you—and you may mark my words—you will come some day to a craggy\r\n",
      "pass in the channel, where the whole of life’s stream will be broken up\r\n",
      "into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to\r\n",

      "its grip, and to hold him so tightly that he could not advance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were ascending the avenue when he thus paused; the hall was before\r\n",

      "detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the\r\n",

      "then to pursue his walk in silence, I ventured to recall him to the\r\n",
      "point whence he had abruptly diverged—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you leave the balcony, sir,” I asked, “when Mdlle. Varens\r\n",
      "entered?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on\r\n",
      "the contrary, waking out of his scowling abstraction, he turned his\r\n",
      "eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his brow. “Oh, I had\r\n",
      "forgotten Céline! Well, to resume. When I saw my charmer thus come in\r\n",
      "accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake\r\n",
      "of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony,\r\n",
      "glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my\r\n",
      "heart’s core. Strange!” he exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the\r\n",
      "point. “Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this,\r\n",
      "young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if\r\n",
      "it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell\r\n",
      "stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like\r\n",
      "you! But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once\r\n",
      "before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made\r\n",
      "to be the recipient of secrets. Besides, I know what sort of a mind I\r\n",
      "have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable\r\n",
      "to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I\r\n",
      "do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.\r\n",
      "The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you,\r\n",
      "you may refresh me.” After this digression he proceeded—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I remained in the balcony. ‘They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,’\r\n",
      "thought I: ‘let me prepare an ambush.’ So putting my hand in through\r\n",
      "the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening\r\n",
      "through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement,\r\n",
      "all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers’\r\n",
      "whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the\r\n",
      "pair came in. My eye was quickly at the aperture. Céline’s chamber-maid\r\n",
      "entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. The couple\r\n",
      "were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there\r\n",
      "was ‘the Varens,’ shining in satin and jewels,—my gifts of course,—and\r\n",
      "there was her companion in an officer’s uniform; and I knew him for a\r\n",
      "young roué of a vicomte—a brainless and vicious youth whom I had\r\n",
      "sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I\r\n",
      "despised him so absolutely. On recognising him, the fang of the snake\r\n",
      "Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for\r\n",
      "Céline sank under an extinguisher. A woman who could betray me for such\r\n",
      "a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less,\r\n",
      "however, than I, who had been her dupe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous,\r\n",
      "mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary\r\n",
      "than enrage a listener. A card of mine lay on the table; this being\r\n",
      "perceived, brought my name under discussion. Neither of them possessed\r\n",
      "energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely\r\n",
      "as they could in their little way: especially Céline, who even waxed\r\n",
      "rather brilliant on my personal defects—deformities she termed them.\r\n",
      "Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of\r\n",
      "what she called my ‘_beauté mâle_:’ wherein she differed diametrically\r\n",
      "from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you\r\n",
      "did not think me handsome. The contrast struck me at the time and—”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! in that case I must abridge. Opening the window, I walked in upon\r\n",
      "them; liberated Céline from my protection; gave her notice to vacate\r\n",
      "her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded\r\n",
      "screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an\r\n",
      "appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.\r\n",
      "Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in\r\n",
      "one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the\r\n",
      "pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew. But unluckily the\r\n",
      "Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adèle, who, she\r\n",
      "affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no\r\n",
      "proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more\r\n",
      "like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she\r\n",
      "abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer. I\r\n",
      "acknowledged no natural claim on Adèle’s part to be supported by me,\r\n",
      "nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that\r\n",
      "she was quite destitute, I e’en took the poor thing out of the slime\r\n",
      "and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the\r\n",
      "wholesome soil of an English country garden. Mrs. Fairfax found you to\r\n",
      "train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a\r\n",
      "French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and\r\n",
      "protégée: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have\r\n",
      "found another place—that you beg me to look out for a new governess,\r\n",
      "&c.—Eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No: Adèle is not answerable for either her mother’s faults or yours: I\r\n",
      "have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense,\r\n",
      "parentless—forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir—I shall\r\n",
      "cling closer to her than before. How could I possibly prefer the spoilt\r\n",
      "pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to\r\n",
      "a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and you too: it darkens.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adèle and Pilot—ran a race\r\n",
      "with her, and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock. When we went\r\n",
      "in, and I had removed her bonnet and coat, I took her on my knee; kept\r\n",
      "her there an hour, allowing her to prattle as she liked: not rebuking\r\n",
      "even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she was apt to\r\n",
      "stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her a superficiality of\r\n",
      "character, inherited probably from her mother, hardly congenial to an\r\n",
      "English mind. Still she had her merits; and I was disposed to\r\n",
      "appreciate all that was good in her to the utmost. I sought in her\r\n",
      "countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none:\r\n",
      "no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship. It was a pity:\r\n",
      "if she could but have been proved to resemble him, he would have\r\n",
      "thought more of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night,\r\n",
      "that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me. As he had\r\n",
      "said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance\r\n",
      "of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman’s passion for a French\r\n",
      "dancer, and her treachery to him, were every-day matters enough, no\r\n",
      "doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the\r\n",
      "paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him when he was in the\r\n",
      "act of expressing the present contentment of his mood, and his newly\r\n",
      "revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs. I meditated\r\n",
      "wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it\r\n",
      "for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my\r\n",
      "master’s manner to myself. The confidence he had thought fit to repose\r\n",
      "in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as\r\n",
      "such. His deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards\r\n",
      "me than at the first. I never seemed in his way; he did not take fits\r\n",
      "of chilling hauteur: when he met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed\r\n",
      "welcome; he had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when\r\n",
      "summoned by formal invitation to his presence, I was honoured by a\r\n",
      "cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power\r\n",
      "to amuse him, and that these evening conferences were sought as much\r\n",
      "for his pleasure as for my benefit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him talk with\r\n",
      "relish. It was his nature to be communicative; he liked to open to a\r\n",
      "mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways (I do\r\n",
      "not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their\r\n",
      "interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange\r\n",
      "novelty by which they were characterised); and I had a keen delight in\r\n",
      "receiving the new ideas he offered, in imagining the new pictures he\r\n",
      "portrayed, and following him in thought through the new regions he\r\n",
      "disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ease of his manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly\r\n",
      "frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he treated me, drew me to\r\n",
      "him. I felt at times as if he were my relation rather than my master:\r\n",
      "yet he was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that; I saw it\r\n",
      "was his way. So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest\r\n",
      "added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred: my thin\r\n",
      "crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled\r\n",
      "up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude, and\r\n",
      "many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object\r\n",
      "I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the\r\n",
      "brightest fire. Yet I had not forgotten his faults; indeed, I could\r\n",
      "not, for he brought them frequently before me. He was proud, sardonic,\r\n",
      "harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew\r\n",
      "that his great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many\r\n",
      "others. He was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when\r\n",
      "sent for to read to him, found him sitting in his library alone, with\r\n",
      "his head bent on his folded arms; and, when he looked up, a morose,\r\n",
      "almost a malignant, scowl blackened his features. But I believed that\r\n",
      "his moodiness, his harshness, and his former faults of morality (I say\r\n",
      "_former_, for now he seemed corrected of them) had their source in some\r\n",
      "cruel cross of fate. I believed he was naturally a man of better\r\n",
      "tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as\r\n",
      "circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny\r\n",
      "encouraged. I thought there were excellent materials in him; though for\r\n",
      "the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot\r\n",
      "deny that I grieved for his grief, whatever that was, and would have\r\n",
      "given much to assuage it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I\r\n",
      "could not sleep for thinking of his look when he paused in the avenue,\r\n",
      "and told how his destiny had risen up before him, and dared him to be\r\n",
      "happy at Thornfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why not?” I asked myself. “What alienates him from the house? Will he\r\n",
      "leave it again soon? Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer\r\n",
      "than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.\r\n",
      "If he does go, the change will be doleful. Suppose he should be absent\r\n",
      "spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will\r\n",
      "seem!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any\r\n",
      "rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and\r\n",
      "lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me. I wished I had\r\n",
      "kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were\r\n",
      "depressed. I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward\r\n",
      "tranquillity was broken. The clock, far down in the hall, struck two.\r\n",
      "Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had\r\n",
      "swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside. I\r\n",
      "said, “Who is there?” Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the\r\n",
      "kitchen-door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his way up\r\n",
      "to the threshold of Mr. Rochester’s chamber: I had seen him lying there\r\n",
      "myself in the mornings. The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down.\r\n",
      "Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again\r\n",
      "through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber. But it\r\n",
      "was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely\r\n",
      "approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing\r\n",
      "incident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a demoniac laugh—low, suppressed, and deep—uttered, as it\r\n",
      "seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. The head of my bed was\r\n",
      "near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my\r\n",
      "bedside—or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and\r\n",
      "could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was\r\n",
      "reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels. My first impulse\r\n",
      "was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, “Who is\r\n",
      "there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something gurgled and moaned. Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery\r\n",
      "towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut\r\n",
      "in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?” thought I.\r\n",
      "Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax. I\r\n",
      "hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the\r\n",
      "door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside,\r\n",
      "and on the matting in the gallery. I was surprised at this\r\n",
      "circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite\r\n",
      "dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and\r\n",
      "left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware\r\n",
      "of a strong smell of burning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester’s, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence. I thought no\r\n",
      "more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh:\r\n",
      "in an instant, I was within the chamber. Tongues of flame darted round\r\n",
      "the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour,\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Wake! wake!” I cried. I shook him, but he only murmured and turned:\r\n",
      "the smoke had stupefied him. Not a moment could be lost: the very\r\n",
      "sheets were kindling, I rushed to his basin and ewer; fortunately, one\r\n",
      "was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water. I heaved\r\n",
      "them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room,\r\n",
      "brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God’s aid,\r\n",
      "succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I\r\n",
      "flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of\r\n",
      "the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.\r\n",
      "Though it was now dark, I knew he was awake; because I heard him\r\n",
      "fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of\r\n",
      "water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there a flood?” he cried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir,” I answered; “but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are\r\n",
      "quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?” he\r\n",
      "demanded. “What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the\r\n",
      "room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven’s name, get up.\r\n",
      "Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and\r\n",
      "what it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There! I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two\r\n",
      "minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be—yes,\r\n",
      "here is my dressing-gown. Now run!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery. He\r\n",
      "took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened\r\n",
      "and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it? and who did it?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I briefly related to him what had transpired: the strange laugh I had\r\n",
      "heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the\r\n",
      "smoke,—the smell of fire which had conducted me to his room; in what\r\n",
      "state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him with all the\r\n",
      "water I could lay hands on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it and who did it?” he asked\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened very gravely; his face, as I went on, expressed more\r\n",
      "concern than astonishment; he did not immediately speak when I had\r\n",
      "concluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her for? What can she\r\n",
      "do? Let her sleep unmolested.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all: just be still. You have a shawl on. If you are not warm\r\n",
      "enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down\r\n",
      "in the arm-chair: there,—I will put it on. Now place your feet on the\r\n",
      "stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few\r\n",
      "minutes. I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return;\r\n",
      "be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey. Don’t\r\n",
      "move, remember, or call any one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went: I watched the light withdraw. He passed up the gallery very\r\n",
      "softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible,\r\n",
      "shut it after him, and the last ray vanished. I was left in total\r\n",
      "darkness. I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long\r\n",
      "time elapsed. I grew weary: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and\r\n",
      "then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.\r\n",
      "I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester’s displeasure by disobeying\r\n",
      "his orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall,\r\n",
      "and I heard his unshod feet tread the matting. “I hope it is he,”\r\n",
      "thought I, “and not something worse.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He re-entered, pale and very gloomy. “I have found it all out,” said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“How, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no reply, but stood with his arms folded, looking on the\r\n",
      "ground. At the end of a few minutes he inquired in rather a peculiar\r\n",
      "tone—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your\r\n",
      "chamber door.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "think, or something like it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,—she\r\n",
      "laughs in that way. She is a singular person.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just so. Grace Poole—you have guessed it. She is, as you say,\r\n",
      "singular—very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject. Meantime, I am\r\n",
      "glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the\r\n",
      "precise details of to-night’s incident. You are no talking fool: say\r\n",
      "nothing about it. I will account for this state of affairs” (pointing\r\n",
      "to the bed): “and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on\r\n",

      "go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What!” he exclaimed, “are you quitting me already, and in that way?”\r\n",

      "“You said I might go, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of\r\n",
      "acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry\r\n",
      "fashion. Why, you have saved my life!—snatched me from a horrible and\r\n",
      "excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual\r\n",
      "strangers! At least shake hands.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a\r\n",
      "debt. I cannot say more. Nothing else that has being would have been\r\n",
      "tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation:\r\n",
      "but you: it is different;—I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.”\r\n",

      "his voice was checked.\r\n",

      "was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble\r\n",

      "breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back. Sense would resist\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed\r\n",
      "this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to\r\n",
      "meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily\r\n",
      "expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the\r\n",
      "schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had\r\n",
      "the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the\r\n",
      "quiet course of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard\r\n",
      "some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the cook’s—that is, John’s wife—and\r\n",
      "even John’s own gruff tones. There were exclamations of “What a mercy\r\n",
      "master was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always dangerous to keep a\r\n",
      "candle lit at night.” “How providential that he had presence of mind to\r\n",
      "think of the water-jug!” “I wonder he waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped\r\n",
      "he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,” &c.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to\r\n",
      "rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I\r\n",
      "saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete\r\n",
      "order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the\r\n",
      "window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about\r\n",
      "to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the\r\n",
      "affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber—a woman\r\n",
      "sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.\r\n",
      "That woman was no other than Grace Poole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff\r\n",
      "gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on\r\n",
      "her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard\r\n",
      "forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the\r\n",
      "paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the\r\n",
      "countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended\r\n",
      "victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed),\r\n",
      "charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was\r\n",
      "amazed—confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start,\r\n",
      "no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of\r\n",
      "guilt, or fear of detection. She said “Good morning, Miss,” in her\r\n",
      "usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more\r\n",
      "tape, went on with her sewing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax’s room and yours are the nearest to\r\n",
      "master’s; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get\r\n",
      "elderly, they often sleep heavy.” She paused, and then added, with a\r\n",
      "sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant\r\n",
      "tone—“But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper:\r\n",
      "perhaps you may have heard a noise?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did,” said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still\r\n",
      "polishing the panes, could not hear me, “and at first I thought it was\r\n",

      "strange one.”\r\n",

      "needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he\r\n",
      "was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was not dreaming,” I said, with some warmth, for her brazen coolness\r\n",
      "provoked me. Again she looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and\r\n",
      "conscious eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you told master that you heard a laugh?” she inquired.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me\r\n",
      "information unawares. The idea struck me that if she discovered I knew\r\n",
      "or suspected her guilt, she would be playing of some of her malignant\r\n",
      "pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On the contrary,” said I, “I bolted my door.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before\r\n",
      "you get into bed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans\r\n",
      "accordingly!” Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied\r\n",
      "sharply, “Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not\r\n",
      "think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be\r\n",
      "dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future” (and I laid marked stress on\r\n",
      "the words) “I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture\r\n",
      "to lie down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It will be wise so to do,” was her answer: “this neighbourhood is as\r\n",
      "quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by\r\n",
      "robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds’\r\n",
      "worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for\r\n",
      "such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has\r\n",
      "never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he\r\n",
      "needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe\r\n",
      "side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt\r\n",
      "between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss,\r\n",
      "are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not\r\n",
      "dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are\r\n",
      "used discreetly.” And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her,\r\n",
      "and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her\r\n",
      "miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the\r\n",
      "cook entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Poole,” said she, addressing Grace, “the servants’ dinner will\r\n",
      "soon be ready: will you come down?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I’ll\r\n",
      "carry it upstairs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll have some meat?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I’ll\r\n",
      "make it myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for\r\n",
      "me: so I departed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax’s account of the curtain conflagration\r\n",
      "during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the\r\n",
      "enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the\r\n",
      "problem of her position at Thornfield and questioning why she had not\r\n",
      "been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed\r\n",
      "from her master’s service. He had almost as much as declared his\r\n",
      "conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause\r\n",
      "withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to\r\n",
      "secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman\r\n",
      "seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependents; so\r\n",
      "much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life,\r\n",
      "he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her\r\n",
      "for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think\r\n",
      "that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea\r\n",
      "could not be admitted. “Yet,” I reflected, “she has been young once;\r\n",
      "her youth would be contemporary with her master’s: Mrs. Fairfax told me\r\n",
      "once, she had lived here many years. I don’t think she can ever have\r\n",
      "been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and\r\n",
      "strength of character to compensate for the want of personal\r\n",
      "advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric:\r\n",
      "Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very\r\n",
      "possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him\r\n",
      "into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret\r\n",
      "influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake\r\n",
      "off, and dare not disregard?” But, having reached this point of\r\n",
      "conjecture, Mrs. Poole’s square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even\r\n",
      "coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind’s eye, that I thought,\r\n",
      "“No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct. Yet,” suggested the\r\n",
      "secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, “_you_ are not\r\n",
      "beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate,\r\n",
      "you have often felt as if he did; and last night—remember his words;\r\n",
      "remember his look; remember his voice!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment\r\n",
      "vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adèle was drawing; I bent\r\n",
      "over her and directed her pencil. She looked up with a sort of start.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Qu’avez-vous, mademoiselle?” said she. “Vos doigts tremblent comme la\r\n",
      "feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am hot, Adèle, with stooping!” She went on sketching; I went on\r\n",
      "thinking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been\r\n",
      "conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself\r\n",
      "with her, and found we were different. Bessie Leaven had said I was\r\n",
      "quite a lady; and she spoke truth—I was a lady. And now I looked much\r\n",
      "better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh,\r\n",
      "more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener\r\n",
      "enjoyments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Evening approaches,” said I, as I looked towards the window. “I have\r\n",
      "never heard Mr. Rochester’s voice or step in the house to-day; but\r\n",
      "surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the\r\n",
      "morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled\r\n",
      "that it is grown impatient.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the\r\n",
      "nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the\r\n",
      "bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I\r\n",
      "fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester’s own tread, and I turned to\r\n",
      "the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut;\r\n",
      "darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he\r\n",
      "often sent for me at seven and eight o’clock, and it was yet but six.\r\n",
      "Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many\r\n",
      "things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace\r\n",
      "Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if\r\n",
      "he really believed it was she who had made last night’s hideous\r\n",
      "attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little\r\n",
      "mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of\r\n",
      "vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in,\r\n",
      "and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the\r\n",
      "verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked\r\n",
      "well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every\r\n",
      "propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without\r\n",
      "fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it\r\n",
      "was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. Thither\r\n",
      "I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I\r\n",
      "imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester’s presence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must want your tea,” said the good lady, as I joined her; “you ate\r\n",
      "so little at dinner. I am afraid,” she continued, “you are not well\r\n",
      "to-day: you look flushed and feverish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, quite well! I never felt better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the\r\n",
      "teapot while I knit off this needle?” Having completed her task, she\r\n",
      "rose to draw down the blind, which she had hitherto kept up, by way, I\r\n",
      "suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast\r\n",
      "deepening into total obscurity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is fair to-night,” said she, as she looked through the panes,\r\n",
      "“though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a\r\n",
      "favourable day for his journey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Journey!—Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he was out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted! He is gone to the Leas,\r\n",
      "Mr. Eshton’s place, ten miles on the other side Millcote. I believe\r\n",
      "there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn,\r\n",
      "Colonel Dent, and others.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you expect him back to-night?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a\r\n",
      "week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they\r\n",
      "are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all\r\n",
      "that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.\r\n",
      "Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is\r\n",
      "a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would\r\n",
      "not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in\r\n",
      "their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his\r\n",
      "wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are there ladies at the Leas?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters—very elegant young\r\n",
      "ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram,\r\n",
      "most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or\r\n",
      "seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a\r\n",
      "Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the\r\n",
      "dining-room that day—how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit\r\n",
      "up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present—all of\r\n",
      "the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of\r\n",
      "the evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was\r\n",
      "Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to\r\n",
      "hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to\r\n",
      "come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw\r\n",
      "a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of\r\n",
      "them—at least most of the younger ones—looked handsome; but Miss Ingram\r\n",
      "was certainly the queen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what was she like?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive\r\n",
      "complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester’s: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then\r\n",
      "she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly\r\n",
      "arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the\r\n",
      "glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an\r\n",
      "amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her\r\n",
      "breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below\r\n",
      "her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it\r\n",
      "contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She was greatly admired, of course?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments.\r\n",
      "She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the\r\n",
      "piano. She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he could sing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to\r\n",
      "listen to her;—and she played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably\r\n",
      "good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large\r\n",
      "fortunes. Old Lord Ingram’s estates were chiefly entailed, and the\r\n",
      "eldest son came in for everything almost.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to\r\n",
      "her: Mr. Rochester, for instance. He is rich, is he not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an\r\n",
      "idea of the sort. But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since\r\n",
      "you began tea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adèle came in, and the\r\n",
      "conversation was turned into another channel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into\r\n",
      "my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring\r\n",
      "back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination’s\r\n",
      "boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her evidence of the hopes,\r\n",
      "wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night—of the\r\n",
      "general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight\r\n",
      "past; Reason having come forward and told, in her own quiet way, a\r\n",
      "plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and\r\n",
      "rabidly devoured the ideal;—I pronounced judgment to this effect:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of\r\n",
      "life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet\r\n",
      "lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_,” I said, “a favourite with Mr. Rochester? _You_ gifted with the\r\n",
      "power of pleasing him? _You_ of importance to him in any way? Go! your\r\n",
      "folly sickens me. And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens\r\n",
      "of preference—equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man\r\n",
      "of the world to a dependent and a novice. How dared you? Poor stupid\r\n",
      "dupe!—Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to\r\n",
      "yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?—Cover your face\r\n",
      "and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind\r\n",
      "puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed\r\n",
      "senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her\r\n",
      "superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in\r\n",
      "all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned\r\n",
      "and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and\r\n",
      "responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatuus_-like, into miry wilds whence\r\n",
      "there is no extrication.\r\n",

      "indigent and insignificant plebeian?’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll do it,” I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew\r\n",
      "calm, and fell asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I kept my word. An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in\r\n",
      "crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory\r\n",
      "miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram. It looked a lovely face\r\n",
      "enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was\r\n",
      "as great as self-control could desire. I derived benefit from the task:\r\n",
      "it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and\r\n",
      "fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my\r\n",
      "heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of\r\n",
      "wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.\r\n",
      "Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent\r\n",
      "calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been\r\n",
      "unequal to maintain, even externally.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XVII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and\r\n",
      "still he did not come. Mrs. Fairfax said she should not be surprised if\r\n",
      "he were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the\r\n",
      "Continent, and not show his face again at Thornfield for a year to\r\n",
      "come; he had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt\r\n",
      "and unexpected. When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange\r\n",
      "chill and failing at the heart. I was actually permitting myself to\r\n",
      "experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits,\r\n",
      "and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to\r\n",
      "order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder—how I\r\n",
      "cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester’s movements a matter\r\n",
      "in which I had any cause to take a vital interest. Not that I humbled\r\n",
      "myself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just\r\n",
      "said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to\r\n",
      "receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protégée, and to be\r\n",
      "grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your\r\n",
      "duty, you have a right to expect at his hands. Be sure that is the only\r\n",
      "tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don’t make him\r\n",
      "the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.\r\n",
      "He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting\r\n",
      "to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a\r\n",
      "gift is not wanted and would be despised.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went on with my day’s business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague\r\n",
      "suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit\r\n",
      "Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and\r\n",
      "pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not\r\n",
      "think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post\r\n",
      "brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is from the master,” said she, as she looked at the direction. “Now\r\n",
      "I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And while she broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking\r\n",
      "my coffee (we were at breakfast): it was hot, and I attributed to that\r\n",
      "circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. Why my hand\r\n",
      "shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into\r\n",
      "my saucer, I did not choose to consider.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being\r\n",
      "busy enough now: for a little while at least,” said Mrs. Fairfax, still\r\n",
      "holding the note before her spectacles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of\r\n",
      "Adèle’s pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her also to\r\n",
      "another bun and refilled her mug with milk, I said, nonchalantly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed he is—in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and\r\n",
      "not alone either. I don’t know how many of the fine people at the Leas\r\n",
      "are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to\r\n",
      "be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I\r\n",
      "am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from\r\n",
      "wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the\r\n",
      "gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.” And Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax swallowed her breakfast and hastened away to commence\r\n",
      "operations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three days were, as she had foretold, busy enough. I had thought\r\n",
      "all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it\r\n",
      "appears I was mistaken. Three women were got to help; and such\r\n",
      "scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets,\r\n",
      "such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors\r\n",
      "and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets\r\n",
      "and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.\r\n",
      "Adèle ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company\r\n",
      "and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her into ecstasies.\r\n",
      "She would have Sophie to look over all her “toilettes,” as she called\r\n",
      "frocks; to furbish up any that were “_passées_,” and to air and arrange\r\n",
      "the new. For herself, she did nothing but caper about in the front\r\n",
      "chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and\r\n",
      "piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the\r\n",
      "chimneys. From school duties she was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had\r\n",
      "pressed me into her service, and I was all day in the storeroom,\r\n",
      "helping (or hindering) her and the cook; learning to make custards and\r\n",
      "cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish\r\n",
      "desert-dishes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for\r\n",
      "dinner at six. During the intervening period I had no time to nurse\r\n",
      "chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody—Adèle\r\n",
      "excepted. Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my\r\n",
      "cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of\r\n",
      "doubts and portents, and dark conjectures. This was when I chanced to\r\n",
      "see the third-storey staircase door (which of late had always been kept\r\n",
      "locked) open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in\r\n",
      "prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her glide along\r\n",
      "the gallery, her quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her\r\n",
      "look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,—just say a word, perhaps,\r\n",
      "to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a\r\n",
      "marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass\r\n",
      "on. She would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her dinner,\r\n",
      "smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her pot of\r\n",
      "porter with her, for her private solace, in her own gloomy, upper\r\n",
      "haunt. Only one hour in the twenty-four did she pass with her\r\n",
      "fellow-servants below; all the rest of her time was spent in some\r\n",
      "low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she sat and\r\n",
      "sewed—and probably laughed drearily to herself,—as companionless as a\r\n",
      "prisoner in his dungeon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except\r\n",
      "me, noticed her habits, or seemed to marvel at them: no one discussed\r\n",
      "her position or employment; no one pitied her solitude or isolation. I\r\n",
      "once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the\r\n",
      "charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject. Leah had been saying\r\n",
      "something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She gets good wages, I guess?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” said Leah; “I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain\r\n",
      "of,—there’s no stinginess at Thornfield; but they’re not one fifth of\r\n",
      "the sum Mrs. Poole receives. And she is laying by: she goes every\r\n",
      "quarter to the bank at Millcote. I should not wonder but she has saved\r\n",
      "enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose\r\n",
      "she’s got used to the place; and then she’s not forty yet, and strong\r\n",
      "and able for anything. It is too soon for her to give up business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is a good hand, I daresay,” said the charwoman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah!—she understands what she has to do,—nobody better,” rejoined Leah\r\n",
      "significantly; “and it is not every one could fill her shoes—not for\r\n",
      "all the money she gets.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That it is not!” was the reply. “I wonder whether the master—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and\r\n",
      "she instantly gave her companion a nudge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Doesn’t she know?” I heard the woman whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Leah shook her head, and the conversation was of course dropped. All I\r\n",
      "had gathered from it amounted to this,—that there was a mystery at\r\n",
      "Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely\r\n",
      "excluded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening;\r\n",
      "carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white\r\n",
      "counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers\r\n",
      "piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as\r\n",
      "hands could make them. The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved\r\n",
      "clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were\r\n",
      "polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard\r\n",
      "flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases\r\n",
      "of exotics bloomed on all sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her best black satin gown, her\r\n",
      "gloves, and her gold watch; for it was her part to receive the\r\n",
      "company,—to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &c. Adèle, too, would be\r\n",
      "dressed: though I thought she had little chance of being introduced to\r\n",
      "the party that day at least. However, to please her, I allowed Sophie\r\n",
      "to apparel her in one of her short, full muslin frocks. For myself, I\r\n",
      "had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my\r\n",
      "sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,—“a\r\n",
      "very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been a mild, serene spring day—one of those days which, towards\r\n",
      "the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth\r\n",
      "as heralds of summer. It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was\r\n",
      "even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It gets late,” said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state. “I am\r\n",
      "glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned;\r\n",
      "for it is past six now. I have sent John down to the gates to see if\r\n",
      "there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in\r\n",
      "the direction of Millcote.” She went to the window. “Here he is!” said\r\n",
      "she. “Well, John” (leaning out), “any news?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’re coming, ma’am,” was the answer. “They’ll be here in ten\r\n",
      "minutes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle flew to the window. I followed, taking care to stand on one side,\r\n",
      "so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels\r\n",
      "were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came\r\n",
      "two open carriages. Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the\r\n",
      "vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen;\r\n",
      "the third was Mr. Rochester, on his black horse, Mesrour, Pilot\r\n",
      "bounding before him; at his side rode a lady, and he and she were the\r\n",
      "first of the party. Her purple riding-habit almost swept the ground,\r\n",
      "her veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent\r\n",
      "folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Ingram!” exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she hurried to her post\r\n",
      "below.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the\r\n",
      "angle of the house, and I lost sight of it. Adèle now petitioned to go\r\n",
      "down; but I took her on my knee, and gave her to understand that she\r\n",
      "must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies,\r\n",
      "either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester would be very angry, &c. “Some natural tears she shed” on\r\n",
      "being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she consented at\r\n",
      "last to wipe them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen’s deep tones and\r\n",
      "ladies’ silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and\r\n",
      "distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of\r\n",
      "the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his fair and gallant guests\r\n",
      "under its roof. Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a\r\n",
      "tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and\r\n",
      "closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Elles changent de toilettes,” said Adèle; who, listening attentively,\r\n",
      "had followed every movement; and she sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Chez maman,” said she, “quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais\r\n",
      "partout, au salon et à leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes\r\n",
      "de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c’était si amusant: comme\r\n",
      "cela on apprend.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t you feel hungry, Adèle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mais oui, mademoiselle: voilà cinq ou six heures que nous n’avons pas\r\n",
      "mangé.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and\r\n",
      "get you something to eat.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs\r\n",
      "which conducted directly to the kitchen. All in that region was fire\r\n",
      "and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection,\r\n",
      "and the cook hung over her crucibles in a frame of mind and body\r\n",
      "threatening spontaneous combustion. In the servants’ hall two coachmen\r\n",
      "and three gentlemen’s gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the\r\n",
      "abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new\r\n",
      "servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about\r\n",
      "everywhere. Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I\r\n",
      "took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate\r\n",
      "or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat. I\r\n",
      "had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind\r\n",
      "me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to\r\n",
      "issue from their chambers. I could not proceed to the schoolroom\r\n",
      "without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being\r\n",
      "surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end,\r\n",
      "which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set\r\n",
      "and twilight gathering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another:\r\n",
      "each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous\r\n",
      "through the dusk. For a moment they stood grouped together at the other\r\n",
      "extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued\r\n",
      "vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a\r\n",
      "bright mist rolls down a hill. Their collective appearance had left on\r\n",
      "me an impression of high-born elegance, such as I had never before\r\n",
      "received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found Adèle peeping through the schoolroom door, which she held ajar.\r\n",
      "“What beautiful ladies!” cried she in English. “Oh, I wish I might go\r\n",
      "to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-by, after\r\n",
      "dinner?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, I don’t; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about.\r\n",
      "Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow:\r\n",
      "here is your dinner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her\r\n",
      "attention for a time. It was well I secured this forage, or both she,\r\n",
      "I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run\r\n",
      "a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much\r\n",
      "engaged to think of us. The dessert was not carried out till after\r\n",
      "nine; and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and\r\n",
      "coffee-cups. I allowed Adèle to sit up much later than usual; for she\r\n",
      "declared she could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept\r\n",
      "opening and shutting below, and people bustling about. Besides, she\r\n",
      "added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she was\r\n",
      "undressed; “et alors quel dommage!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I told her stories as long as she would listen to them; and then for a\r\n",
      "change I took her out into the gallery. The hall lamp was now lit, and\r\n",
      "it amused her to look over the balustrade and watch the servants\r\n",
      "passing backwards and forwards. When the evening was far advanced, a\r\n",
      "sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been\r\n",
      "removed; Adèle and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.\r\n",
      "Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a\r\n",
      "lady who sang, and very sweet her notes were. The solo over, a duet\r\n",
      "followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the\r\n",
      "intervals. I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was\r\n",
      "wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to\r\n",
      "discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester;\r\n",
      "and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in\r\n",
      "framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clock struck eleven. I looked at Adèle, whose head leant against my\r\n",
      "shoulder; her eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her up in my arms and\r\n",
      "carried her off to bed. It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies\r\n",
      "sought their chambers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the\r\n",
      "party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood. They set out\r\n",
      "early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I\r\n",
      "witnessed both the departure and the return. Miss Ingram, as before,\r\n",
      "was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at\r\n",
      "her side; the two rode a little apart from the rest. I pointed out this\r\n",
      "circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me—\r\n",

      "“You said it was not likely they should think of being married,” said\r\n",
      "I, “but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other\r\n",
      "ladies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And she him,” I added; “look how she leans her head towards him as if\r\n",
      "she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have\r\n",
      "never had a glimpse of it yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will see her this evening,” answered Mrs. Fairfax. “I happened to\r\n",
      "remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adèle wished to be introduced to the\r\n",
      "ladies, and he said: ‘Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after\r\n",
      "dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,” I\r\n",
      "answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not\r\n",
      "think you would like appearing before so gay a party—all strangers; and\r\n",
      "he replied, in his quick way—‘Nonsense! If she objects, tell her it is\r\n",
      "my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her\r\n",
      "in case of contumacy.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will not give him that trouble,” I answered. “I will go, if no\r\n",
      "better may be; but I don’t like it. Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea. I’ll tell you how to\r\n",
      "manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance,\r\n",
      "which is the most disagreeable part of the business. You must go into\r\n",
      "the drawing-room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the\r\n",
      "dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not\r\n",
      "stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester see you are there and then slip away—nobody will notice you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will these people remain long, do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. After the Easter\r\n",
      "recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote,\r\n",
      "will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so\r\n",
      "protracted a stay at Thornfield.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I\r\n",
      "was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room. Adèle had been in a\r\n",
      "state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she was to be presented to the\r\n",
      "ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the\r\n",
      "operation of dressing her that she sobered down. Then the importance of\r\n",
      "the process quickly steadied her, and by the time she had her curls\r\n",
      "arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her pink satin frock put\r\n",
      "on, her long sash tied, and her lace mittens adjusted, she looked as\r\n",
      "grave as any judge. No need to warn her not to disarrange her attire:\r\n",
      "when she was dressed, she sat demurely down in her little chair, taking\r\n",
      "care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she should crease\r\n",
      "it, and assured me she would not stir thence till I was ready. This I\r\n",
      "quickly was: my best dress (the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss\r\n",
      "Temple’s wedding, and never worn since) was soon put on; my hair was\r\n",
      "soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed. We\r\n",
      "descended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that\r\n",
      "through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner. We found the\r\n",
      "apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth,\r\n",
      "and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers\r\n",
      "with which the tables were adorned. The crimson curtain hung before the\r\n",
      "arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party\r\n",
      "in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of\r\n",
      "their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most\r\n",
      "solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I\r\n",
      "pointed out to her. I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from\r\n",
      "a table near, endeavoured to read. Adèle brought her stool to my feet;\r\n",
      "ere long she touched my knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it, Adèle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendre une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques,\r\n",
      "mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You think too much of your ‘toilette,’ Adèle: but you may have a\r\n",
      "flower.” And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her sash. She\r\n",
      "sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her cup of happiness\r\n",
      "were now full. I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not\r\n",
      "suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the\r\n",
      "little Parisienne’s earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back\r\n",
      "from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre\r\n",
      "pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent\r\n",
      "dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the\r\n",
      "opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the\r\n",
      "impression of a much larger number. Some of them were very tall; many\r\n",
      "were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that\r\n",
      "seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon. I rose\r\n",
      "and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the\r\n",
      "others only stared at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and\r\n",
      "buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds. Some of\r\n",
      "them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and\r\n",
      "ottomans: some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books:\r\n",
      "the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but\r\n",
      "clear tone which seemed habitual to them. I knew their names\r\n",
      "afterwards, and may as well mention them now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her daughters. She had\r\n",
      "evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her\r\n",
      "daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naïve, and child-like in\r\n",
      "face and manner, and piquant in form; her white muslin dress and blue\r\n",
      "sash became her well. The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant\r\n",
      "in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term\r\n",
      "_minois chiffoné_: both sisters were fair as lilies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect,\r\n",
      "very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful\r\n",
      "sheen: her dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume,\r\n",
      "and within the circlet of a band of gems.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like. She\r\n",
      "had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. Her black\r\n",
      "satin dress, her scarf of rich foreign lace, and her pearl ornaments,\r\n",
      "pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the three most distinguished—partly, perhaps, because the tallest\r\n",
      "figures of the band—were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her daughters,\r\n",
      "Blanche and Mary. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.\r\n",
      "The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her shape was still fine;\r\n",
      "her hair (by candle-light at least) still black; her teeth, too, were\r\n",
      "still apparently perfect. Most people would have termed her a splendid\r\n",
      "woman of her age: and so she was, no doubt, physically speaking; but\r\n",
      "then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her\r\n",
      "bearing and countenance. She had Roman features and a double chin,\r\n",
      "disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me\r\n",
      "not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the\r\n",
      "chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost\r\n",
      "preternatural erectness. She had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it\r\n",
      "reminded me of Mrs. Reed’s; she mouthed her words in speaking; her\r\n",
      "voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,—very\r\n",
      "intolerable, in short. A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of\r\n",
      "some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (I suppose she thought)\r\n",
      "with a truly imperial dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,—straight and tall as poplars.\r\n",
      "Mary was too slim for her height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.\r\n",
      "I regarded her, of course, with special interest. First, I wished to\r\n",
      "see whether her appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax’s description;\r\n",
      "secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted\r\n",
      "of her; and thirdly—it will out!—whether it were such as I should fancy\r\n",
      "likely to suit Mr. Rochester’s taste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As far as person went, she answered point for point, both to my picture\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Fairfax’s description. The noble bust, the sloping shoulders,\r\n",
      "the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;—but\r\n",
      "her face? Her face was like her mother’s; a youthful unfurrowed\r\n",
      "likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride. It\r\n",
      "was not, however, so saturnine a pride! she laughed continually; her\r\n",
      "laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her arched\r\n",
      "and haughty lip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Genius is said to be self-conscious. I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram\r\n",
      "was a genius, but she was self-conscious—remarkably self-conscious\r\n",
      "indeed. She entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs.\r\n",
      "Dent. It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she\r\n",
      "said, she liked flowers, “especially wild ones;” Miss Ingram had, and\r\n",
      "she ran over its vocabulary with an air. I presently perceived she was\r\n",
      "(what is vernacularly termed) _trailing_ Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on\r\n",
      "her ignorance; her _trail_ might be clever, but it was decidedly not\r\n",
      "good-natured. She played: her execution was brilliant; she sang: her\r\n",
      "voice was fine; she talked French apart to her mamma; and she talked it\r\n",
      "well, with fluency and with a good accent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer\r\n",
      "features too, and a skin some shades fairer (Miss Ingram was dark as a\r\n",
      "Spaniard)—but Mary was deficient in life: her face lacked expression,\r\n",
      "her eye lustre; she had nothing to say, and having once taken her seat,\r\n",
      "remained fixed like a statue in its niche. The sisters were both\r\n",
      "attired in spotless white.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be\r\n",
      "likely to make? I could not tell—I did not know his taste in female\r\n",
      "beauty. If he liked the majestic, she was the very type of majesty:\r\n",
      "then she was accomplished, sprightly. Most gentlemen would admire her,\r\n",
      "I thought; and that he _did_ admire her, I already seemed to have\r\n",
      "obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to\r\n",
      "see them together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You are not to suppose, reader, that Adèle has all this time been\r\n",
      "sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies\r\n",
      "entered, she rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and\r\n",
      "said with gravity—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bon jour, mesdames.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Miss Ingram had looked down at her with a mocking air, and\r\n",
      "exclaimed, “Oh, what a little puppet!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Lynn had remarked, “It is Mr. Rochester’s ward, I suppose—the\r\n",
      "little French girl he was speaking of.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her hand, and given her a kiss. Amy and\r\n",
      "Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a love of a child!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then they had called her to a sofa, where she now sat, ensconced\r\n",
      "between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English;\r\n",
      "absorbing not only the young ladies’ attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton\r\n",
      "and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her heart’s content.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in\r\n",
      "the shade—if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the\r\n",
      "window-curtain half hides me. Again the arch yawns; they come. The\r\n",
      "collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is\r\n",
      "very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall,\r\n",
      "some young. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed;\r\n",
      "and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man. Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of\r\n",
      "the district, is gentleman-like: his hair is quite white, his eyebrows\r\n",
      "and whiskers still dark, which gives him something of the appearance of\r\n",
      "a “père noble de théâtre.” Lord Ingram, like his sisters, is very tall;\r\n",
      "like them, also, he is handsome; but he shares Mary’s apathetic and\r\n",
      "listless look: he seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of\r\n",
      "blood or vigour of brain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And where is Mr. Rochester?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him enter. I\r\n",
      "try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes\r\n",
      "of the purse I am forming—I wish to think only of the work I have in my\r\n",
      "hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my\r\n",
      "lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his figure, and I inevitably recall\r\n",
      "the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him, what he\r\n",
      "deemed, an essential service, and he, holding my hand, and looking down\r\n",
      "on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager\r\n",
      "to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part. How near had I approached\r\n",
      "him at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his\r\n",
      "and my relative positions? Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we\r\n",
      "were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him to come and speak to\r\n",
      "me. I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he took a seat at\r\n",
      "the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the\r\n",
      "ladies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No sooner did I see that his attention was riveted on them, and that I\r\n",
      "might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn\r\n",
      "involuntarily to his face; I could not keep their lids under control:\r\n",
      "they would rise, and the irids would fix on him. I looked, and had an\r\n",
      "acute pleasure in looking,—a precious yet poignant pleasure; pure gold,\r\n",
      "with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing\r\n",
      "man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned,\r\n",
      "yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Most true is it that “beauty is in the eye of the gazer.” My master’s\r\n",
      "colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows,\r\n",
      "deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,—all energy, decision,\r\n",
      "will,—were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than\r\n",
      "beautiful to me; they were full of an interest, an influence that quite\r\n",
      "mastered me,—that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them\r\n",
      "in his. I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought\r\n",
      "hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and\r\n",
      "now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously arrived,\r\n",
      "green and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I compared him with his guests. What was the gallant grace of the\r\n",
      "Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,—even the military\r\n",
      "distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his look of native pith\r\n",
      "and genuine power? I had no sympathy in their appearance, their\r\n",
      "expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them\r\n",
      "attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking. I saw them\r\n",
      "smile, laugh—it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul\r\n",
      "in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as\r\n",
      "their laugh. I saw Mr. Rochester smile:—his stern features softened;\r\n",
      "his eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and\r\n",
      "sweet. He was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I\r\n",
      "wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so\r\n",
      "penetrating: I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under\r\n",
      "it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved. “He is not\r\n",
      "to them what he is to me,” I thought: “he is not of their kind. I\r\n",
      "believe he is of mine;—I am sure he is—I feel akin to him—I understand\r\n",
      "the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth\r\n",
      "sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood\r\n",
      "and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him. Did I say, a few days\r\n",
      "since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at\r\n",
      "his hands? Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than\r\n",
      "as a paymaster? Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous\r\n",
      "feeling I have gathers impulsively round him. I know I must conceal my\r\n",
      "sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care\r\n",
      "much for me. For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I\r\n",
      "have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that\r\n",
      "I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him. I must, then,\r\n",
      "repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:—and yet, while I\r\n",
      "breathe and think, I must love him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become\r\n",
      "lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry. Colonel Dent and\r\n",
      "Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud\r\n",
      "dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together. Sir\r\n",
      "George—whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,—a very big, and\r\n",
      "very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa,\r\n",
      "coffee-cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word. Mr. Frederick Lynn\r\n",
      "has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her the engravings\r\n",
      "of a splendid volume: she looks, smiles now and then, but apparently\r\n",
      "says little. The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms\r\n",
      "on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she glances up\r\n",
      "at him, and chatters like a wren: she likes him better than she does\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester. Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the\r\n",
      "feet of Louisa: Adèle shares it with him: he is trying to talk French\r\n",
      "with her, and Louisa laughs at his blunders. With whom will Blanche\r\n",
      "Ingram pair? She is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully\r\n",
      "over an album. She seems waiting to be sought; but she will not wait\r\n",
      "too long: she herself selects a mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as\r\n",
      "solitary as she stands by the table: she confronts him, taking her\r\n",
      "station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nor am I.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the heart, and there waking sensation strangely. I waited till the last\r\n",
      "deep and full vibration had expired—till the tide of talk, checked an\r\n",
      "instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and\r\n",
      "made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near. Thence a\r\n",
      "narrow passage led into the hall: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal\r\n",
      "was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the\r\n",
      "mat at the foot of the staircase. I heard the dining-room door unclose;\r\n",

      "What is the matter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the\r\n",
      "flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig\r\n",

      "Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how\r\n",
      "different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and\r\n",
      "solitude I had passed beneath its roof! All sad feelings seemed now\r\n",
      "driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was\r\n",
      "life everywhere, movement all day long. You could not now traverse the\r\n",
      "gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so\r\n",
      "tenantless, without encountering a smart lady’s-maid or a dandy valet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The kitchen, the butler’s pantry, the servants’ hall, the entrance\r\n",
      "hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still\r\n",
      "when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather\r\n",
      "called their occupants out into the grounds. Even when that weather was\r\n",
      "broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast\r\n",
      "over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied,\r\n",
      "in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wondered what they were going to do the first evening a change of\r\n",
      "entertainment was proposed: they spoke of “playing charades,” but in my\r\n",
      "ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in,\r\n",
      "the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the\r\n",
      "chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were\r\n",
      "running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was\r\n",
      "summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in\r\n",
      "shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the\r\n",
      "third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of\r\n",
      "brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace\r\n",
      "lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a\r\n",
      "selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the\r\n",
      "boudoir within the drawing-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him, and\r\n",
      "was selecting certain of their number to be of his party. “Miss Ingram\r\n",
      "is mine, of course,” said he: afterwards he named the two Misses\r\n",
      "Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He looked at me: I happened to be near him, as I\r\n",
      "had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent’s bracelet, which had got\r\n",
      "loose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you play?” he asked. I shook my head. He did not insist, which I\r\n",
      "rather feared he would have done; he allowed me to return quietly to my\r\n",
      "usual seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He and his aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which\r\n",
      "was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs. One of\r\n",
      "the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I\r\n",
      "should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the\r\n",
      "notion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” I heard her say: “she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the\r\n",
      "bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise\r\n",
      "chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,\r\n",
      "lay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester’s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,\r\n",
      "rang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her\r\n",
      "guardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents\r\n",
      "of a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the\r\n",
      "magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her\r\n",
      "head, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while\r\n",
      "Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their\r\n",
      "stations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it\r\n",
      "was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,\r\n",
      "Colonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then\r\n",
      "the Colonel called out—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\r\n",
      "displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The\r\n",
      "drawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the\r\n",
      "dining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two\r\n",
      "back within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised\r\n",
      "as an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded\r\n",
      "by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been\r\n",
      "transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes\r\n",
      "and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he\r\n",
      "looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the\r\n",
      "bowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was\r\n",
      "attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the\r\n",
      "waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\r\n",
      "beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\r\n",
      "supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of\r\n",
      "form and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the\r\n",
      "idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\r\n",
      "doubtless the character she intended to represent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;\r\n",
      "she again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now\r\n",
      "seemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her\r\n",
      "pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his robe\r\n",
      "he then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets\r\n",
      "and earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid\r\n",
      "the treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her\r\n",
      "looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and\r\n",
      "the rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\r\n",
      "wanting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they\r\n",
      "could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.\r\n",
      "Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;”\r\n",
      "whereupon the curtain again descended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;\r\n",
      "the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and\r\n",
      "coarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a\r\n",
      "deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very\r\n",
      "dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all\r\n",
      "extinguished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\r\n",
      "his knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;\r\n",
      "though the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose\r\n",
      "from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a\r\n",
      "scuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling\r\n",
      "hair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to\r\n",
      "his wrists were attached fetters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their\r\n",
      "ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram; she was complimenting him on his acting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know,” said she, “that, of the three characters, I liked you in\r\n",
      "the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a\r\n",
      "gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is all the soot washed from my face?” he asked, turning it towards\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alas! yes: the more’s the pity! Nothing could be more becoming to your\r\n",
      "complexion than that ruffian’s rouge.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would like a hero of the road then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian\r\n",
      "bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour\r\n",
      "since, in the presence of all these witnesses.” She giggled, and her\r\n",
      "colour rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Dent,” continued Mr. Rochester, “it is your turn.” And as the\r\n",
      "other party withdrew, he and his band took the vacated seats. Miss\r\n",
      "Ingram placed herself at her leader’s right hand; the other diviners\r\n",
      "filled the chairs on each side of him and her. I did not now watch the\r\n",
      "actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my\r\n",
      "attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on\r\n",
      "the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.\r\n",
      "What charade Colonel Dent and his party played, what word they chose,\r\n",
      "how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see\r\n",
      "the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him; I see her incline her head towards\r\n",
      "him, till the jetty curls almost touch his shoulder and wave against\r\n",
      "his cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged\r\n",
      "glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle\r\n",
      "returns in memory at this moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I\r\n",
      "could not unlove him now, merely because I found that he had ceased to\r\n",
      "notice me—because I might pass hours in his presence, and he would\r\n",
      "never once turn his eyes in my direction—because I saw all his\r\n",
      "attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with\r\n",
      "the hem of her robes as she passed; who, if ever her dark and imperious\r\n",
      "eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object\r\n",
      "too mean to merit observation. I could not unlove him, because I felt\r\n",
      "sure he would soon marry this very lady—because I read daily in her a\r\n",
      "proud security in his intentions respecting her—because I witnessed\r\n",
      "hourly in him a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing\r\n",
      "rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness,\r\n",
      "captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though\r\n",
      "much to create despair. Much too, you will think, reader, to engender\r\n",
      "jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a\r\n",
      "woman in Miss Ingram’s. But I was not jealous: or very rarely;—the\r\n",
      "nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss\r\n",
      "Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she was too inferior to excite the\r\n",
      "feeling. Pardon the seeming paradox; I mean what I say. She was very\r\n",
      "showy, but she was not genuine: she had a fine person, many brilliant\r\n",
      "attainments; but her mind was poor, her heart barren by nature: nothing\r\n",
      "bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted\r\n",
      "by its freshness. She was not good; she was not original: she used to\r\n",
      "repeat sounding phrases from books: she never offered, nor had, an\r\n",
      "opinion of her own. She advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she did\r\n",
      "not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were\r\n",
      "not in her. Too often she betrayed this, by the undue vent she gave to\r\n",
      "a spiteful antipathy she had conceived against little Adèle: pushing\r\n",
      "her away with some contumelious epithet if she happened to approach\r\n",
      "her; sometimes ordering her from the room, and always treating her with\r\n",
      "coldness and acrimony. Other eyes besides mine watched these\r\n",
      "manifestations of character—watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.\r\n",
      "Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his\r\n",
      "intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity—this\r\n",
      "guardedness of his—this perfect, clear consciousness of his fair one’s\r\n",
      "defects—this obvious absence of passion in his sentiments towards her,\r\n",
      "that my ever-torturing pain arose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw he was going to marry her, for family, perhaps political reasons,\r\n",
      "because her rank and connections suited him; I felt he had not given\r\n",
      "her his love, and that her qualifications were ill adapted to win from\r\n",
      "him that treasure. This was the point—this was where the nerve was\r\n",
      "touched and teased—this was where the fever was sustained and fed: _she\r\n",
      "could not charm him_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If she had managed the victory at once, and he had yielded and\r\n",
      "sincerely laid his heart at her feet, I should have covered my face,\r\n",
      "turned to the wall, and (figuratively) have died to them. If Miss\r\n",
      "Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour,\r\n",
      "kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two\r\n",
      "tigers—jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I\r\n",
      "should have admired her—acknowledged her excellence, and been quiet for\r\n",
      "the rest of my days: and the more absolute her superiority, the deeper\r\n",
      "would have been my admiration—the more truly tranquil my quiescence.\r\n",
      "But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram’s efforts at\r\n",
      "fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure—herself\r\n",
      "unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft\r\n",
      "launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success,\r\n",
      "when her pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what\r\n",
      "she wished to allure—to witness _this_, was to be at once under\r\n",
      "ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Because, when she failed, I saw how she might have succeeded. Arrows\r\n",
      "that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester’s breast and fell\r\n",
      "harmless at his feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have\r\n",
      "quivered keen in his proud heart—have called love into his stern eye,\r\n",
      "and softness into his sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons\r\n",
      "a silent conquest might have been won.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so\r\n",
      "near to him?” I asked myself. “Surely she cannot truly like him, or not\r\n",
      "like him with true affection! If she did, she need not coin her smiles\r\n",
      "so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so\r\n",
      "elaborate, graces so multitudinous. It seems to me that she might, by\r\n",
      "merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get\r\n",
      "nigher his heart. I have seen in his face a far different expression\r\n",
      "from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting\r\n",
      "him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious\r\n",
      "arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it—to answer\r\n",
      "what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without\r\n",
      "grimace—and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed\r\n",
      "one like a fostering sunbeam. How will she manage to please him when\r\n",
      "they are married? I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might\r\n",
      "be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest\r\n",
      "woman the sun shines on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester’s project of\r\n",
      "marrying for interest and connections. It surprised me when I first\r\n",
      "discovered that such was his intention: I had thought him a man\r\n",
      "unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his choice of a\r\n",
      "wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the\r\n",
      "parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him or\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled\r\n",
      "into them, doubtless, from their childhood. All their class held these\r\n",
      "principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as\r\n",
      "I could not fathom. It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him,\r\n",
      "I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very\r\n",
      "obviousness of the advantages to the husband’s own happiness offered by\r\n",
      "this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general\r\n",
      "adoption of which I was quite ignorant: otherwise I felt sure all the\r\n",
      "world would act as I wished to act.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my\r\n",
      "master: I was forgetting all his faults, for which I had once kept a\r\n",
      "sharp look-out. It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of\r\n",
      "his character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just\r\n",
      "weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment. Now I saw no bad. The\r\n",
      "sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once,\r\n",
      "were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was\r\n",
      "pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid. And\r\n",
      "as for the vague something—was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a\r\n",
      "designing or a desponding expression?—that opened upon a careful\r\n",
      "observer, now and then, in his eye, and closed again before one could\r\n",
      "fathom the strange depth partially disclosed; that something which used\r\n",
      "to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst\r\n",
      "volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and\r\n",
      "seen it gape: that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with\r\n",
      "throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Instead of wishing to\r\n",
      "shun, I longed only to dare—to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram\r\n",
      "happy, because one day she might look into the abyss at her leisure,\r\n",
      "explore its secrets and analyse their nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his future bride—saw\r\n",
      "only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their\r\n",
      "movements of importance—the rest of the party were occupied with their\r\n",
      "own separate interests and pleasures. The Ladies Lynn and Ingram\r\n",
      "continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two\r\n",
      "turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting\r\n",
      "gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on\r\n",
      "which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets. Mild Mrs.\r\n",
      "Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes\r\n",
      "bestowed a courteous word or smile on me. Sir George Lynn, Colonel\r\n",
      "Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice\r\n",
      "business. Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang\r\n",
      "to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly\r\n",
      "to the gallant speeches of the other. Sometimes all, as with one\r\n",
      "consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal\r\n",
      "actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and—because closely connected\r\n",
      "with him—Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party. If he was\r\n",
      "absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal\r\n",
      "over the spirits of his guests; and his re-entrance was sure to give a\r\n",
      "fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The want of his animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one\r\n",
      "day that he had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not\r\n",
      "likely to return till late. The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had\r\n",
      "proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond\r\n",
      "Hay, was consequently deferred. Some of the gentlemen were gone to the\r\n",
      "stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were\r\n",
      "playing billiards in the billiard-room. The dowagers Ingram and Lynn\r\n",
      "sought solace in a quiet game at cards. Blanche Ingram, after having\r\n",
      "repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Eshton to draw her into conversation, had first murmured over some\r\n",
      "sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a\r\n",
      "novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a\r\n",
      "sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious\r\n",
      "hours of absence. The room and the house were silent: only now and then\r\n",
      "the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the\r\n",
      "hour to dress for dinner, when little Adèle, who knelt by me in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Voilà Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her sofa: the others,\r\n",
      "too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a\r\n",
      "crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible\r\n",
      "on the wet gravel. A post-chaise was approaching.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What can possess him to come home in that style?” said Miss Ingram.\r\n",
      "“He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and\r\n",
      "Pilot was with him:—what has he done with the animals?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she said this, she approached her tall person and ample garments so\r\n",
      "near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking\r\n",
      "of my spine: in her eagerness she did not observe me at first, but when\r\n",
      "she did, she curled her lip and moved to another casement. The\r\n",
      "post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman\r\n",
      "alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester; it\r\n",
      "was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How provoking!” exclaimed Miss Ingram: “you tiresome monkey!”\r\n",
      "(apostrophising Adèle), “who perched you up in the window to give false\r\n",
      "intelligence?” and she cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in\r\n",
      "fault.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.\r\n",
      "He bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her the eldest lady present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,” said he, “when my\r\n",
      "friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long\r\n",
      "journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate\r\n",
      "acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His manner was polite; his accent, in speaking, struck me as being\r\n",
      "somewhat unusual,—not precisely foreign, but still not altogether\r\n",
      "English: his age might be about Mr. Rochester’s,—between thirty and\r\n",
      "forty; his complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he was a\r\n",
      "fine-looking man, at first sight especially. On closer examination, you\r\n",
      "detected something in his face that displeased, or rather that failed\r\n",
      "to please. His features were regular, but too relaxed: his eye was\r\n",
      "large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant\r\n",
      "life—at least so I thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till\r\n",
      "after dinner that I saw him again: he then seemed quite at his ease.\r\n",
      "But I liked his physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as\r\n",
      "being at the same time unsettled and inanimate. His eye wandered, and\r\n",
      "had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him an odd look, such as I\r\n",
      "never remembered to have seen. For a handsome and not an\r\n",
      "unamiable-looking man, he repelled me exceedingly: there was no power\r\n",
      "in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape: no firmness in that\r\n",
      "aquiline nose and small cherry mouth; there was no thought on the low,\r\n",
      "even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him with the light of the\r\n",
      "girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him—for he occupied an\r\n",
      "arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as\r\n",
      "if he were cold, I compared him with Mr. Rochester. I think (with\r\n",
      "deference be it spoken) the contrast could not be much greater between\r\n",
      "a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the\r\n",
      "rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship\r\n",
      "theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage\r\n",
      "that “extremes meet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him, and I caught at times\r\n",
      "scraps of their conversation across the room. At first I could not make\r\n",
      "much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary\r\n",
      "Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that\r\n",
      "reached me at intervals. These last were discussing the stranger; they\r\n",
      "both called him “a beautiful man.” Louisa said he was “a love of a\r\n",
      "creature,” and she “adored him;” and Mary instanced his “pretty little\r\n",
      "mouth, and nice nose,” as her ideal of the charming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!” cried Louisa,—“so\r\n",
      "smooth—none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and\r\n",
      "such a placid eye and smile!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other\r\n",
      "side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to\r\n",
      "Hay Common.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire,\r\n",
      "and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then\r\n",
      "I learned that he was but just arrived in England, and that he came\r\n",
      "from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his face was so\r\n",
      "sallow, and that he sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the\r\n",
      "house. Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated\r\n",
      "the West Indies as his residence; and it was with no little surprise I\r\n",
      "gathered, ere long, that he had there first seen and become acquainted\r\n",
      "with Mr. Rochester. He spoke of his friend’s dislike of the burning\r\n",
      "heats, the hurricanes, and rainy seasons of that region. I knew Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought\r\n",
      "the continent of Europe had bounded his wanderings; till now I had\r\n",
      "never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was pondering these things, when an incident, and a somewhat\r\n",
      "unexpected one, broke the thread of my musings. Mr. Mason, shivering as\r\n",
      "some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the\r\n",
      "fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still\r\n",
      "shone hot and red. The footman who brought the coal, in going out,\r\n",
      "stopped near Mr. Eshton’s chair, and said something to him in a low\r\n",
      "voice, of which I heard only the words, “old woman,”—“quite\r\n",
      "troublesome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself\r\n",
      "off,” replied the magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—stop!” interrupted Colonel Dent. “Don’t send her away, Eshton; we\r\n",
      "might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.” And\r\n",
      "speaking aloud, he continued—“Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common\r\n",
      "to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother\r\n",
      "Bunches is in the servants’ hall at this moment, and insists upon being\r\n",
      "brought in before ‘the quality,’ to tell them their fortunes. Would you\r\n",
      "like to see her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely, colonel,” cried Lady Ingram, “you would not encourage such a\r\n",
      "low impostor? Dismiss her, by all means, at once!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,” said the footman; “nor\r\n",
      "can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating\r\n",
      "her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and\r\n",
      "says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in\r\n",
      "here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does she want?” asked Mrs. Eshton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“‘To tell the gentry their fortunes,’ she says, ma’am; and she swears\r\n",
      "she must and will do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is she like?” inquired the Misses Eshton, in a breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, she’s a real sorceress!” cried Frederick Lynn. “Let us have her\r\n",
      "in, of course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure,” rejoined his brother; “it would be a thousand pities to\r\n",
      "throw away such a chance of fun.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear boys, what are you thinking about?” exclaimed Mrs. Lynn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,”\r\n",
      "chimed in the Dowager Ingram.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, mama, but you can—and will,” pronounced the haughty voice of\r\n",
      "Blanche, as she turned round on the piano-stool; where till now she had\r\n",
      "sat silent, apparently examining sundry sheets of music. “I have a\r\n",
      "curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame\r\n",
      "forward.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My darling Blanche! recollect—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do—I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will—quick,\r\n",
      "Sam!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—yes—yes!” cried all the juveniles, both ladies and gentlemen. “Let\r\n",
      "her come—it will be excellent sport!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The footman still lingered. “She looks such a rough one,” said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go!” ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery\r\n",
      "and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She won’t come now,” said he. “She says it’s not her mission to appear\r\n",
      "before the ‘vulgar herd’ (them’s her words). I must show her into a\r\n",
      "room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her\r\n",
      "one by one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see now, my queenly Blanche,” began Lady Ingram, “she encroaches.\r\n",
      "Be advised, my angel girl—and—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Show her into the library, of course,” cut in the “angel girl.” “It is\r\n",
      "not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean\r\n",
      "to have her all to myself. Is there a fire in the library?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am—but she looks such a tinkler.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Sam vanished; and mystery, animation, expectation rose to full\r\n",
      "flow once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s ready now,” said the footman, as he reappeared. “She wishes to\r\n",
      "know who will be her first visitor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies\r\n",
      "go,” said Colonel Dent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sam went and returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She says, sir, that she’ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble\r\n",
      "themselves to come near her; nor,” he added, with difficulty\r\n",
      "suppressing a titter, “any ladies either, except the young, and\r\n",
      "single.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By Jove, she has taste!” exclaimed Henry Lynn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram rose solemnly: “I go first,” she said, in a tone which\r\n",
      "might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in\r\n",
      "the van of his men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause—reflect!” was her mama’s cry; but\r\n",
      "she swept past her in stately silence, passed through the door which\r\n",
      "Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her enter the library.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it “le cas” to wring\r\n",
      "her hands: which she did accordingly. Miss Mary declared she felt, for\r\n",
      "her part, she never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under\r\n",
      "their breath, and looked a little frightened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the\r\n",
      "library-door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Would she laugh? Would she take it as a joke? All eyes met her with a\r\n",
      "glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and\r\n",
      "coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to\r\n",
      "her seat, and took it in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Blanche?” said Lord Ingram.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did she say, sister?” asked Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did you think? How do you feel? Is she a real fortune-teller?”\r\n",
      "demanded the Misses Eshton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, now, good people,” returned Miss Ingram, “don’t press upon me.\r\n",
      "Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you\r\n",
      "seem, by the importance of you all—my good mama included—ascribe to\r\n",
      "this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the\r\n",
      "house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman. I have seen a\r\n",
      "gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of\r\n",
      "palmistry and told me what such people usually tell. My whim is\r\n",
      "gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in\r\n",
      "the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her chair, and so declined\r\n",
      "further conversation. I watched her for nearly half-an-hour: during all\r\n",
      "that time she never turned a page, and her face grew momently darker,\r\n",
      "more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment. She\r\n",
      "had obviously not heard anything to her advantage: and it seemed to me,\r\n",
      "from her prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she herself,\r\n",
      "notwithstanding her professed indifference, attached undue importance\r\n",
      "to whatever revelations had been made her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During all that time she never turned a page\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not\r\n",
      "go alone; and yet they all wished to go. A negotiation was opened\r\n",
      "through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and\r\n",
      "fro, till, I think, the said Sam’s calves must have ached with the\r\n",
      "exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from\r\n",
      "the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her in a body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram’s had been: we heard\r\n",
      "hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and\r\n",
      "at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came\r\n",
      "running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure she is something not right!” they cried, one and all. “She\r\n",
      "told us such things! She knows all about us!” and they sank breathless\r\n",
      "into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pressed for further explanation, they declared she had told them of\r\n",
      "things they had said and done when they were mere children; described\r\n",
      "books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that\r\n",
      "different relations had presented to them. They affirmed that she had\r\n",
      "even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the\r\n",
      "name of the person she liked best in the world, and informed them of\r\n",
      "what they most wished for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further\r\n",
      "enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes,\r\n",
      "ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.\r\n",
      "The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again\r\n",
      "and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning\r\n",
      "had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the\r\n",
      "younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully\r\n",
      "engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I\r\n",
      "turned, and saw Sam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young\r\n",
      "single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she\r\n",
      "will not go till she has seen all. I thought it must be you: there is\r\n",
      "no one else for it. What shall I tell her?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I will go by all means,” I answered: and I was glad of the\r\n",
      "unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity. I slipped\r\n",
      "out of the room, unobserved by any eye—for the company were gathered in\r\n",
      "one mass about the trembling trio just returned—and I closed the door\r\n",
      "quietly behind me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you like, miss,” said Sam, “I’ll wait in the hall for you; and if\r\n",
      "she frightens you, just call and I’ll come in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.” Nor was\r\n",

      "The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl—if\r\n",
      "Sibyl she were—was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the\r\n",
      "chimney-corner. She had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a\r\n",
      "broad-brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under\r\n",
      "her chin. An extinguished candle stood on the table; she was bending\r\n",
      "over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a\r\n",
      "prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she muttered the words to\r\n",
      "herself, as most old women do, while she read; she did not desist\r\n",
      "immediately on my entrance: it appeared she wished to finish a\r\n",
      "paragraph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with\r\n",
      "sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire. I felt now as\r\n",
      "composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the\r\n",
      "gipsy’s appearance to trouble one’s calm. She shut her book and slowly\r\n",
      "looked up; her hat-brim partially shaded her face, yet I could see, as\r\n",
      "she raised it, that it was a strange one. It looked all brown and\r\n",
      "black: elf-locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed\r\n",
      "under her chin, and came half over her cheeks, or rather jaws: her eye\r\n",
      "confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and you want your fortune told?” she said, in a voice as decided\r\n",
      "as her glance, as harsh as her features.\r\n",

      "drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke. Having\r\n",
      "indulged a while in this sedative, she raised her bent body, took the\r\n",
      "pipe from her lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to\r\n",
      "let down my window-blind. The consequence was, that when the moon,\r\n",
      "which was full and bright (for the night was fine), came in her course\r\n",
      "to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me\r\n",
      "through the unveiled panes, her glorious gaze roused me. Awaking in the\r\n",
      "dead of night, I opened my eyes on her disk—silver-white and crystal\r\n",
      "clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn: I half rose, and stretched my\r\n",
      "arm to draw the curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good God! What a cry!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night—its silence—its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp,\r\n",
      "a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed.\r\n",
      "The cry died, and was not renewed. Indeed, whatever being uttered that\r\n",
      "fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor\r\n",
      "on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the\r\n",
      "cloud shrouding his eyrie. The thing delivering such utterance must\r\n",
      "rest ere it could repeat the effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead. And\r\n",
      "overhead—yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling—I now heard a\r\n",
      "struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered\r\n",
      "voice shouted—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Help! help! help!” three times rapidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will no one come?” it cried; and then, while the staggering and\r\n",
      "stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rochester! Rochester! for God’s sake, come!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery.\r\n",
      "Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and\r\n",
      "there was silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued\r\n",
      "from my apartment. The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations,\r\n",
      "terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one\r\n",
      "looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled. Gentlemen and\r\n",
      "ladies alike had quitted their beds; and “Oh! what is it?”—“Who is\r\n",
      "hurt?”—“What has happened?”—“Fetch a light!”—“Is it fire?”—“Are there\r\n",
      "robbers?”—“Where shall we run?” was demanded confusedly on all hands.\r\n",
      "But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They\r\n",
      "ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the\r\n",
      "confusion was inextricable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where the devil is Rochester?” cried Colonel Dent. “I cannot find him\r\n",
      "in his bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here! here!” was shouted in return. “Be composed, all of you: I’m\r\n",
      "coming.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "advanced with a candle: he had just descended from the upper storey.\r\n",
      "One of the ladies ran to him directly; she seized his arm: it was Miss\r\n",
      "Ingram.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What awful event has taken place?” said she. “Speak! let us know the\r\n",
      "worst at once!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But don’t pull me down or strangle me,” he replied: for the Misses\r\n",
      "Eshton were clinging about him now; and the two dowagers, in vast white\r\n",
      "wrappers, were bearing down on him like ships in full sail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All’s right!—all’s right!” he cried. “It’s a mere rehearsal of Much\r\n",
      "Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And dangerous he looked: his black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself\r\n",
      "by an effort, he added—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A servant has had the nightmare; that is all. She’s an excitable,\r\n",
      "nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or\r\n",
      "something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright. Now,\r\n",
      "then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is\r\n",
      "settled, she cannot be looked after. Gentlemen, have the goodness to\r\n",
      "set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in\r\n",
      "evincing superiority to idle terrors. Amy and Louisa, return to your\r\n",
      "nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames” (to the dowagers),\r\n",
      "“you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill\r\n",
      "gallery any longer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he contrived to\r\n",
      "get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories. I did\r\n",
      "not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as\r\n",
      "unnoticed I had left it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself\r\n",
      "carefully. The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that\r\n",
      "had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had\r\n",
      "proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not\r\n",
      "a servant’s dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and\r\n",
      "that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention\r\n",
      "framed to pacify his guests. I dressed, then, to be ready for\r\n",
      "emergencies. When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out\r\n",
      "over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for I knew not\r\n",
      "what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry,\r\n",
      "struggle, and call.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and\r\n",
      "in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert. It\r\n",
      "seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon\r\n",
      "declined: she was about to set. Not liking to sit in the cold and\r\n",
      "darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was. I\r\n",
      "left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I\r\n",
      "stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Am I wanted?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you up?” asked the voice I expected to hear, viz., my master’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And dressed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come out, then, quietly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want you,” he said: “come this way: take your time, and make no\r\n",
      "noise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a\r\n",
      "cat. He glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the\r\n",
      "dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and\r\n",
      "stood at his side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you a sponge in your room?” he asked in a whisper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you any salts—volatile salts?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go back and fetch both.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer,\r\n",
      "and once more retraced my steps. He still waited; he held a key in his\r\n",
      "hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he put it in the lock;\r\n",
      "he paused, and addressed me again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t turn sick at the sight of blood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt a thrill while I answered him; but no coldness, and no\r\n",
      "faintness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just give me your hand,” he said: “it will not do to risk a fainting\r\n",
      "fit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I put my fingers into his. “Warm and steady,” was his remark: he turned\r\n",
      "the key and opened the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax\r\n",
      "showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry\r\n",
      "was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had\r\n",
      "then been concealed. This door was open; a light shone out of the room\r\n",
      "within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog\r\n",
      "quarrelling. Mr. Rochester, putting down his candle, said to me, “Wait\r\n",
      "a minute,” and he went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of\r\n",
      "laughter greeted his entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace\r\n",
      "Poole’s own goblin ha! ha! _She_ then was there. He made some sort of\r\n",
      "arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him:\r\n",
      "he came out and closed the door behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here, Jane!” he said; and I walked round to the other side of a large\r\n",
      "bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of\r\n",
      "the chamber. An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it,\r\n",
      "dressed with the exception of his coat; he was still; his head leant\r\n",
      "back; his eyes were closed. Mr. Rochester held the candle over him; I\r\n",
      "recognised in his pale and seemingly lifeless face—the stranger, Mason:\r\n",
      "I saw too that his linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in\r\n",
      "blood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hold the candle,” said Mr. Rochester, and I took it: he fetched a\r\n",
      "basin of water from the washstand: “Hold that,” said he. I obeyed. He\r\n",
      "took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he\r\n",
      "asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils. Mr. Mason\r\n",
      "shortly unclosed his eyes; he groaned. Mr. Rochester opened the shirt\r\n",
      "of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he sponged\r\n",
      "away blood, trickling fast down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there immediate danger?” murmured Mr. Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pooh! No—a mere scratch. Don’t be so overcome, man: bear up! I’ll\r\n",
      "fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you’ll be able to be removed by\r\n",
      "morning, I hope. Jane,” he continued.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an\r\n",
      "hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it\r\n",
      "returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that\r\n",
      "stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose. You will not speak to\r\n",
      "him on any pretext—and—Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if\r\n",
      "you speak to her: open your lips—agitate yourself—and I’ll not answer\r\n",
      "for the consequences.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the poor man groaned; he looked as if he dared not move; fear,\r\n",
      "either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him.\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded\r\n",
      "to use it as he had done. He watched me a second, then saying,\r\n",
      "“Remember!—No conversation,” he left the room. I experienced a strange\r\n",
      "feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his retreating\r\n",
      "step ceased to be heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic\r\n",
      "cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and\r\n",
      "hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes—that\r\n",
      "was appalling—the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of\r\n",
      "Grace Poole bursting out upon me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I must keep to my post, however. I must watch this ghastly\r\n",
      "countenance—these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose—these eyes now\r\n",
      "shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me,\r\n",
      "and ever glazed with the dulness of horror. I must dip my hand again\r\n",
      "and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling\r\n",
      "gore. I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my\r\n",
      "employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round\r\n",
      "me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver\r\n",
      "strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite—whose front,\r\n",
      "divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the\r\n",
      "twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame;\r\n",
      "while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here\r\n",
      "or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his\r\n",
      "brow; now St. John’s long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face\r\n",
      "of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and\r\n",
      "threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor—of Satan himself—in his\r\n",
      "subordinate’s form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the\r\n",
      "movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den. But since\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester’s visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but\r\n",
      "three sounds at three long intervals,—a step creak, a momentary renewal\r\n",
      "of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then my own thoughts worried me. What crime was this, that lived\r\n",
      "incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled\r\n",
      "nor subdued by the owner?—what mystery, that broke out now in fire and\r\n",
      "now in blood, at the deadest hours of night? What creature was it,\r\n",
      "that, masked in an ordinary woman’s face and shape, uttered the voice,\r\n",
      "now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And this man I bent over—this commonplace, quiet stranger—how had he\r\n",
      "become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at\r\n",
      "him? What made him seek this quarter of the house at an untimely\r\n",
      "season, when he should have been asleep in bed? I had heard Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester assign him an apartment below—what brought him here! And why,\r\n",
      "now, was he so tame under the violence or treachery done him? Why did\r\n",
      "he so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why\r\n",
      "_did_ Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? His guest had been\r\n",
      "outraged, his own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted\r\n",
      "against; and both attempts he smothered in secrecy and sank in\r\n",
      "oblivion! Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that\r\n",
      "the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness\r\n",
      "of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me\r\n",
      "of this. It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive\r\n",
      "disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active\r\n",
      "energy of the other: whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester’s dismay when\r\n",
      "he heard of Mr. Mason’s arrival? Why had the mere name of this\r\n",
      "unresisting individual—whom his word now sufficed to control like a\r\n",
      "child—fallen on him, a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on\r\n",
      "an oak?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oh! I could not forget his look and his paleness when he whispered:\r\n",
      "“Jane, I have got a blow—I have got a blow, Jane.” I could not forget\r\n",
      "how the arm had trembled which he rested on my shoulder: and it was no\r\n",
      "light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the\r\n",
      "vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When will he come? When will he come?” I cried inwardly, as the night\r\n",
      "lingered and lingered—as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened:\r\n",
      "and neither day nor aid arrived. I had, again and again, held the water\r\n",
      "to Mason’s white lips; again and again offered him the stimulating\r\n",
      "salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental\r\n",
      "suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast\r\n",
      "prostrating his strength. He moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and\r\n",
      "lost, I feared he was dying; and I might not even speak to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived\r\n",
      "streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then\r\n",
      "approaching. Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his distant\r\n",
      "kennel in the courtyard: hope revived. Nor was it unwarranted: in five\r\n",
      "minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was\r\n",
      "relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has\r\n",
      "seemed shorter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester entered, and with him the surgeon he had been to fetch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Carter, be on the alert,” he said to this last: “I give you but\r\n",
      "half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting\r\n",
      "the patient downstairs and all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But is he fit to move, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must\r\n",
      "be kept up. Come, set to work.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind,\r\n",
      "let in all the daylight he could; and I was surprised and cheered to\r\n",
      "see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to\r\n",
      "brighten the east. Then he approached Mason, whom the surgeon was\r\n",
      "already handling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, my good fellow, how are you?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s done for me, I fear,” was the faint reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a whit!—courage! This day fortnight you’ll hardly be a pin the\r\n",
      "worse of it: you’ve lost a little blood; that’s all. Carter, assure him\r\n",
      "there’s no danger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can do that conscientiously,” said Carter, who had now undone the\r\n",
      "bandages; “only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have\r\n",
      "bled so much—but how is this? The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well\r\n",
      "as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth\r\n",
      "here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She bit me,” he murmured. “She worried me like a tigress, when\r\n",
      "Rochester got the knife from her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at\r\n",
      "once,” said Mr. Rochester.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But under such circumstances, what could one do?” returned Mason. “Oh,\r\n",
      "it was frightful!” he added, shuddering. “And I did not expect it: she\r\n",
      "looked so quiet at first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I warned you,” was his friend’s answer; “I said—be on your guard when\r\n",
      "you go near her. Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had\r\n",
      "me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and\r\n",
      "alone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought I could have done some good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but,\r\n",
      "however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not\r\n",
      "taking my advice; so I’ll say no more. Carter—hurry!—hurry! The sun\r\n",
      "will soon rise, and I must have him off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this\r\n",
      "other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She sucked the blood: she said she’d drain my heart,” said Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust,\r\n",
      "horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he\r\n",
      "only said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don’t repeat\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I could forget it,” was the answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish\r\n",
      "Town, you may think of her as dead and buried—or rather, you need not\r\n",
      "think of her at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Impossible to forget this night!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as\r\n",
      "dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking\r\n",
      "now. There!—Carter has done with you or nearly so; I’ll make you decent\r\n",
      "in a trice. Jane” (he turned to me for the first time since his\r\n",
      "re-entrance), “take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk\r\n",
      "straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the\r\n",
      "wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them\r\n",
      "here; and be nimble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went; sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles\r\n",
      "named, and returned with them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now,” said he, “go to the other side of the bed while I order his\r\n",
      "toilet; but don’t leave the room: you may be wanted again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I retired as directed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?” inquired Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester presently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir; all was very still.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for\r\n",
      "your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven\r\n",
      "long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here,\r\n",
      "Carter, help him on with his waist-coat. Where did you leave your\r\n",
      "furred cloak? You can’t travel a mile without that, I know, in this\r\n",
      "damned cold climate. In your room?—Jane, run down to Mr. Mason’s\r\n",
      "room,—the one next mine,—and fetch a cloak you will see there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and\r\n",
      "edged with fur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, I’ve another errand for you,” said my untiring master; “you must\r\n",
      "away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!—a\r\n",
      "clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open\r\n",
      "the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a\r\n",
      "little glass you will find there,—quick!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a\r\n",
      "dose myself, on my own responsibility. I got this cordial at Rome, of\r\n",
      "an Italian charlatan—a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not\r\n",
      "a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as\r\n",
      "now, for instance. Jane, a little water.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle\r\n",
      "on the washstand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That will do;—now wet the lip of the phial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did so; he measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented\r\n",
      "it to Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or\r\n",
      "so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But will it hurt me?—is it inflammatory?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Drink! drink! drink!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He was\r\n",
      "dressed now: he still looked pale, but he was no longer gory and\r\n",
      "sullied. Mr. Rochester let him sit three minutes after he had swallowed\r\n",
      "the liquid; he then took his arm—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now I am sure you can get on your feet,” he said—“try.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The patient rose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Carter, take him under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard;\r\n",
      "step out—that’s it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do feel better,” remarked Mr. Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure you do. Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs;\r\n",
      "unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise\r\n",
      "you will see in the yard—or just outside, for I told him not to drive\r\n",
      "his rattling wheels over the pavement—to be ready; we are coming: and,\r\n",
      "Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of\r\n",
      "rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent. The side-passage\r\n",
      "door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible: all\r\n",
      "the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a\r\n",
      "post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box,\r\n",
      "stationed outside. I approached him, and said the gentlemen were\r\n",
      "coming; he nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The\r\n",
      "stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet\r\n",
      "drawn over the servants’ chamber windows; little birds were just\r\n",
      "twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped\r\n",
      "like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the\r\n",
      "carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all\r\n",
      "else was still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gentlemen now appeared. Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the\r\n",
      "surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him into the\r\n",
      "chaise; Carter followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take care of him,” said Mr. Rochester to the latter, “and keep him at\r\n",
      "your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to\r\n",
      "see how he gets on. Richard, how is it with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind—good-bye,\r\n",
      "Dick.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fairfax—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well what is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be:\r\n",
      "let her—” he stopped and burst into tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,” was the answer: he\r\n",
      "shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet would to God there was an end of all this!” added Mr. Rochester,\r\n",
      "as he closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This done, he moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in\r\n",
      "the wall bordering the orchard. I, supposing he had done with me,\r\n",
      "prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him call\r\n",
      "“Jane!” He had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,” he said; “that\r\n",
      "house is a mere dungeon: don’t you feel it so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,” he answered; “and you\r\n",
      "see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is\r\n",
      "slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate,\r\n",
      "and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark. Now _here_”\r\n",
      "(he pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered) “all is real, sweet,\r\n",
      "and pure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees,\r\n",
      "and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all\r\n",
      "sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses,\r\n",
      "pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant\r\n",
      "herbs. They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams,\r\n",
      "followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just\r\n",
      "entering the dappled east, and his light illumined the wreathed and\r\n",
      "dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, will you have a flower?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to\r\n",
      "me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you like this sunrise, Jane? That sky with its high and light\r\n",
      "clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm—this placid\r\n",
      "and balmly atmosphere?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do, very much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have passed a strange night, Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it has made you look pale—were you afraid when I left you alone\r\n",
      "with Mason?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I had fastened the door—I had the key in my pocket: I should have\r\n",
      "been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb—my pet lamb—so near a\r\n",
      "wolf’s den, unguarded: you were safe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes! don’t trouble your head about her—put the thing out of your\r\n",
      "thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never fear—I will take care of myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.\r\n",
      "To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack\r\n",
      "and spue fire any day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led. Your influence, sir, is\r\n",
      "evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or\r\n",
      "wilfully injure you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no! Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me—but,\r\n",
      "unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive\r\n",
      "me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him\r\n",
      "how to avert the danger.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it\r\n",
      "from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be? Annihilated\r\n",
      "in a moment. Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to\r\n",
      "him ‘Do that,’ and the thing has been done. But I cannot give him\r\n",
      "orders in this case: I cannot say ‘Beware of harming me, Richard;’ for\r\n",
      "it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is\r\n",
      "possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are\r\n",
      "my little friend, are you not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely: I see you do. I see genuine contentment in your gait and\r\n",
      "mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing\r\n",
      "me—working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say,\r\n",
      "‘_all that is right_:’ for if I bid you do what you thought wrong,\r\n",
      "there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no\r\n",
      "lively glance and animated complexion. My friend would then turn to me,\r\n",
      "quiet and pale, and would say, ‘No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot\r\n",
      "do it, because it is wrong;’ and would become immutable as a fixed\r\n",
      "star. Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare\r\n",
      "not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you\r\n",
      "are, you should transfix me at once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir,\r\n",
      "you are very safe.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a\r\n",
      "rustic seat. Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but\r\n",
      "I stood before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit,” he said; “the bench is long enough for two. You don’t hesitate\r\n",
      "to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I answered him by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been\r\n",
      "unwise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew—while all the\r\n",
      "flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their\r\n",
      "young ones’ breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do\r\n",
      "their first spell of work—I’ll put a case to you, which you must\r\n",
      "endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you\r\n",
      "are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you\r\n",
      "err in staying.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir; I am content.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:—suppose you were no longer a\r\n",
      "girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from\r\n",
      "childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive\r\n",
      "that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from\r\n",
      "what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life\r\n",
      "and taint all your existence. Mind, I don’t say a _crime_; I am not\r\n",
      "speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make\r\n",
      "the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_. The results of\r\n",
      "what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you\r\n",
      "take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful\r\n",
      "nor culpable. Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the\r\n",
      "very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which\r\n",
      "you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. Bitter and base\r\n",
      "associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here\r\n",
      "and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure—I mean in\r\n",
      "heartless, sensual pleasure—such as dulls intellect and blights\r\n",
      "feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of\r\n",
      "voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance—how or where no\r\n",
      "matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities\r\n",
      "which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered;\r\n",
      "and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint. Such\r\n",
      "society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back—higher\r\n",
      "wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to\r\n",
      "spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal\r\n",
      "being. To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle\r\n",
      "of custom—a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience\r\n",
      "sanctifies nor your judgment approves?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good\r\n",
      "spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response! Vain\r\n",
      "aspiration! The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle\r\n",
      "Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the\r\n",
      "tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Mr. Rochester propounded his query:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man\r\n",
      "justified in daring the world’s opinion, in order to attach to him for\r\n",
      "ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own\r\n",
      "peace of mind and regeneration of life?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir,” I answered, “a wanderer’s repose or a sinner’s reformation\r\n",
      "should never depend on a fellow-creature. Men and women die;\r\n",
      "philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one\r\n",
      "you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals\r\n",
      "for strength to amend and solace to heal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the instrument—the instrument! God, who does the work, ordains the\r\n",
      "instrument. I have myself—I tell it you without parable—been a worldly,\r\n",
      "dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for\r\n",
      "my cure in—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused: the birds went on carolling, the leaves lightly rustling. I\r\n",
      "almost wondered they did not check their songs and whispers to catch\r\n",
      "the suspended revelation; but they would have had to wait many\r\n",
      "minutes—so long was the silence protracted. At last I looked up at the\r\n",
      "tardy speaker: he was looking eagerly at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Little friend,” said he, in quite a changed tone—while his face\r\n",
      "changed too, losing all its softness and gravity, and becoming harsh\r\n",
      "and sarcastic—“you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram:\r\n",

      "signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has\r\n",
      "not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life,\r\n",
      "because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist\r\n",
      "(for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged\r\n",
      "relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the\r\n",
      "source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal\r\n",
      "comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies\r\n",
      "of Nature with man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie\r\n",
      "Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little\r\n",
      "child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either\r\n",
      "to one’s self or one’s kin. The saying might have worn out of my\r\n",
      "memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served\r\n",
      "indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the\r\n",
      "deathbed of her little sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during\r\n",
      "the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not\r\n",
      "brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my\r\n",
      "arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with\r\n",
      "daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It\r\n",
      "was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it\r\n",
      "nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the\r\n",
      "apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven\r\n",
      "successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did not like this iteration of one idea—this strange recurrence of\r\n",
      "one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the\r\n",
      "vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I\r\n",
      "had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it\r\n",
      "was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by\r\n",
      "a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax’s room. On repairing\r\n",
      "thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a\r\n",
      "gentleman’s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he\r\n",
      "held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,” he said, rising as I entered;\r\n",
      "“but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were\r\n",

      "“Doing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate\r\n",
      "amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into\r\n",
      "jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he\r\n",
      "returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the\r\n",
      "knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He\r\n",
      "came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give\r\n",
      "up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by\r\n",
      "his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he\r\n",
      "was dead. How he died, God knows!—they say he killed himself.”\r\n",

      "stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of\r\n",
      "poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John’s\r\n",
      "death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.\r\n",
      "She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather\r\n",
      "better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making\r\n",
      "signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however,\r\n",
      "that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she\r\n",
      "made out the words, ‘Bring Jane—fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to\r\n",
      "her.’ Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means\r\n",
      "anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and\r\n",
      "advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but\r\n",
      "their mother grew so restless, and said, ‘Jane, Jane,’ so many times,\r\n",
      "that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can\r\n",
      "get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow\r\n",
      "morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hall, and recommended him to the care of John’s wife, and the\r\n",
      "attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the\r\n",
      "stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;—yes:\r\n",
      "she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the\r\n",
      "billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices\r\n",
      "resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton,\r\n",
      "and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some\r\n",
      "courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one\r\n",
      "I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss\r\n",
      "Ingram’s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily:\r\n",
      "her eyes seemed to demand, “What can the creeping creature want now?”\r\n",
      "and when I said, in a low voice, “Mr. Rochester,” she made a movement\r\n",
      "as if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the\r\n",
      "moment—it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe\r\n",
      "of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had\r\n",
      "been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the\r\n",
      "expression of her haughty lineaments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does that person want you?” she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester turned to see who the “person” was. He made a curious\r\n",
      "grimace—one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations—threw down his\r\n",
      "cue and followed me from the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Jane?” he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom\r\n",
      "door, which he had shut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his\r\n",

      "have you in the world, Jane?” he asked, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. “Five shillings, sir.” He\r\n",
      "took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as\r\n",
      "if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: “Here,”\r\n",
      "said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but\r\n",
      "fifteen. I told him I had no change.\r\n",

      "“Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "asked myself; “I want to commence my packing.” The dinner-bell rang,\r\n",
      "and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no\r\n",

      "I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o’clock in the afternoon of\r\n",
      "the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It\r\n",
      "was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little\r\n",
      "white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were\r\n",
      "burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth,\r\n",
      "nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a\r\n",
      "corner.\r\n",

      "entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Bessie,” said I, after I had kissed her; “and I trust I am not\r\n",
      "too late. How is Mrs. Reed?—Alive still, I hope.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The\r\n",

      "house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and\r\n",
      "wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss,\r\n",
      "and then I will go up with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle\r\n",
      "and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my\r\n",
      "bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was\r\n",
      "glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my\r\n",
      "travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when\r\n",
      "a child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling\r\n",
      "about—setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and\r\n",
      "butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert\r\n",
      "or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in\r\n",
      "former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light\r\n",
      "foot and good looks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit\r\n",
      "still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the\r\n",
      "fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with\r\n",
      "my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me\r\n",
      "with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled\r\n",
      "and obeyed her as in bygone days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of\r\n",
      "a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master,\r\n",
      "whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was\r\n",
      "rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me\r\n",
      "kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay\r\n",
      "company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details\r\n",
      "Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she\r\n",
      "relished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my\r\n",
      "bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall.\r\n",
      "It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago,\r\n",
      "walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning\r\n",
      "in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered\r\n",
      "heart—a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation—to seek the chilly\r\n",
      "harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same\r\n",
      "hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet;\r\n",
      "and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face\r\n",
      "of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own\r\n",
      "powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my\r\n",
      "wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment\r\n",
      "extinguished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shall go into the breakfast-room first,” said Bessie, as she\r\n",
      "preceded me through the hall; “the young ladies will be there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article\r\n",
      "of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first\r\n",
      "introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still\r\n",
      "covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could\r\n",
      "distinguish the two volumes of Bewick’s British Birds occupying their\r\n",
      "old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver’s Travels and the Arabian\r\n",
      "Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but\r\n",
      "the living things had altered past recognition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as\r\n",
      "Miss Ingram—very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There\r\n",
      "was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme\r\n",
      "plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen\r\n",
      "collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of\r\n",
      "a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza,\r\n",
      "though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that\r\n",
      "elongated and colourless visage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I\r\n",
      "remembered—the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a\r\n",
      "full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and\r\n",
      "regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The\r\n",
      "hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from\r\n",
      "her sister’s—so much more flowing and becoming—it looked as stylish as\r\n",
      "the other’s looked puritanical.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother—and only one;\r\n",
      "the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent’s Cairngorm eye: the\r\n",
      "blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and\r\n",
      "chin—perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable\r\n",
      "hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me\r\n",
      "by the name of “Miss Eyre.” Eliza’s greeting was delivered in a short,\r\n",
      "abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her\r\n",
      "eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her “How\r\n",
      "d’ye do?” several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so\r\n",
      "on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry\r\n",
      "side-glances that measured me from head to foot—now traversing the\r\n",
      "folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain\r\n",
      "trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of\r\n",
      "letting you know that they think you a “quiz” without actually saying\r\n",
      "the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner,\r\n",
      "nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point,\r\n",
      "without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power\r\n",
      "over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised\r\n",
      "to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the\r\n",
      "semi-sarcastic attentions of the other—Eliza did not mortify, nor\r\n",
      "Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about;\r\n",
      "within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more\r\n",
      "potent than any they could raise—pains and pleasures so much more acute\r\n",
      "and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to\r\n",
      "inflict or bestow—that their airs gave me no concern either for good or\r\n",
      "bad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is Mrs. Reed?” I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who\r\n",
      "thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an\r\n",
      "unexpected liberty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you\r\n",
      "can see her to-night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If,” said I, “you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I\r\n",
      "should be much obliged to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Georgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide.\r\n",
      "“I know she had a particular wish to see me,” I added, “and I would not\r\n",
      "defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,” remarked Eliza. I soon\r\n",
      "rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I\r\n",
      "would just step out to Bessie—who was, I dared say, in the kitchen—and\r\n",
      "ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or\r\n",
      "not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my\r\n",
      "errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my\r\n",
      "habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I\r\n",
      "should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next\r\n",
      "morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a\r\n",
      "foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt,\r\n",
      "and I must stay with her till she was better—or dead: as to her\r\n",
      "daughters’ pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself\r\n",
      "independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me\r\n",
      "a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two,\r\n",
      "had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I\r\n",
      "met Bessie on the landing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Missis is awake,” said she; “I have told her you are here: come and\r\n",
      "let us see if she will know you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so\r\n",
      "often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I\r\n",
      "hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood\r\n",
      "on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great\r\n",
      "four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table,\r\n",
      "the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been\r\n",
      "sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I\r\n",
      "looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim\r\n",
      "outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to\r\n",
      "leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I\r\n",
      "approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled\r\n",
      "pillows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well did I remember Mrs. Reed’s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar\r\n",
      "image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance\r\n",
      "and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman\r\n",
      "in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other\r\n",
      "emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong\r\n",
      "yearning to forget and forgive all injuries—to be reconciled and clasp\r\n",
      "hands in amity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever—there was that\r\n",
      "peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised,\r\n",
      "imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and\r\n",
      "hate! and how the recollection of childhood’s terrors and sorrows\r\n",
      "revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and\r\n",
      "kissed her: she looked at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is this Jane Eyre?” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it\r\n",
      "no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her\r\n",
      "hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should\r\n",
      "at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable\r\n",
      "natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so\r\n",
      "readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face\r\n",
      "rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she\r\n",
      "regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me—her feeling\r\n",
      "towards me—was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony\r\n",
      "eye—opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears—that she was resolved\r\n",
      "to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give\r\n",
      "her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to\r\n",
      "subdue her—to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will.\r\n",
      "My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their\r\n",
      "source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over\r\n",
      "the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You sent for me,” I said, “and I am here; and it is my intention to\r\n",
      "stay till I see how you get on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things\r\n",
      "over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a\r\n",
      "difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to\r\n",
      "say—let me see—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken\r\n",
      "place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the\r\n",
      "bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed\r\n",
      "it down: she was at once irritated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit up!” said she; “don’t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are\r\n",
      "you Jane Eyre?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am Jane Eyre.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.\r\n",
      "Such a burden to be left on my hands—and so much annoyance as she\r\n",
      "caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and\r\n",
      "her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of\r\n",
      "one’s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or\r\n",
      "like a fiend—no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to\r\n",
      "get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The\r\n",
      "fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did\r\n",
      "not die: but I said she did—I wish she had died!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband’s only\r\n",
      "sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family’s\r\n",
      "disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her\r\n",
      "death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I\r\n",
      "entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its\r\n",
      "maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it—a sickly,\r\n",
      "whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long—not\r\n",
      "screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.\r\n",
      "Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been\r\n",
      "his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He\r\n",
      "would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the\r\n",
      "darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed\r\n",
      "their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to\r\n",
      "his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep\r\n",
      "the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out\r\n",
      "of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all\r\n",
      "resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my\r\n",
      "brothers—he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me\r\n",
      "with letters for money! I have no more money to give him: we are\r\n",
      "getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of\r\n",
      "the house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that—yet how are we\r\n",
      "to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of\r\n",
      "mortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses—poor boy! He is\r\n",
      "beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded—his look is frightful—I\r\n",
      "feel ashamed for him when I see him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was getting much excited. “I think I had better leave her now,”\r\n",
      "said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards\r\n",
      "night—in the morning she is calmer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rose. “Stop!” exclaimed Mrs. Reed, “there is another thing I wished\r\n",
      "to say. He threatens me—he continually threatens me with his own death,\r\n",
      "or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great\r\n",
      "wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to\r\n",
      "a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the\r\n",
      "money to be had?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she\r\n",
      "succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed,\r\n",
      "and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with\r\n",
      "her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor\r\n",
      "forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on\r\n",
      "as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold,\r\n",
      "indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or\r\n",
      "writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister.\r\n",
      "Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and\r\n",
      "take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for\r\n",
      "occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me,\r\n",
      "and they served me for both.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to\r\n",
      "take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in\r\n",
      "sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened\r\n",
      "momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of\r\n",
      "imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a\r\n",
      "ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad’s\r\n",
      "head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in\r\n",
      "a hedge-sparrow’s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to\r\n",
      "be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad\r\n",
      "point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and\r\n",
      "prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour\r\n",
      "gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with\r\n",
      "features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that\r\n",
      "brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight\r\n",
      "ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means\r\n",
      "narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it:\r\n",
      "of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted\r\n",
      "on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had\r\n",
      "left them to the last, because they required the most careful working.\r\n",
      "I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and\r\n",
      "sombre; the irids lustrous and large. “Good! but not quite the thing,”\r\n",
      "I thought, as I surveyed the effect: “they want more force and spirit;”\r\n",
      "and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more\r\n",
      "brilliantly—a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a\r\n",
      "friend’s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young\r\n",
      "ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the\r\n",
      "speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that a portrait of some one you know?” asked Eliza, who had\r\n",
      "approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head,\r\n",
      "and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in\r\n",
      "fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was\r\n",
      "that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look.\r\n",
      "The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that “an ugly man.”\r\n",
      "They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their\r\n",
      "portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana\r\n",
      "produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing:\r\n",
      "this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the\r\n",
      "grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a\r\n",
      "confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of\r\n",
      "the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago—of the\r\n",
      "admiration she had there excited—the attention she had received; and I\r\n",
      "even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of\r\n",
      "the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft\r\n",
      "conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and,\r\n",
      "in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day\r\n",
      "improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from\r\n",
      "day to day: they always ran on the same theme—herself, her loves, and\r\n",
      "woes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother’s\r\n",
      "illness, or her brother’s death, or the present gloomy state of the\r\n",
      "family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of\r\n",
      "past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed\r\n",
      "about five minutes each day in her mother’s sick-room, and no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never\r\n",
      "saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say\r\n",
      "what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She\r\n",
      "had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself\r\n",
      "before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular\r\n",
      "portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she\r\n",
      "studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common\r\n",
      "Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that\r\n",
      "volume, and she said, “the Rubric.” Three hours she gave to stitching,\r\n",
      "with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large\r\n",
      "enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this\r\n",
      "article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new\r\n",
      "church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her\r\n",
      "diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the\r\n",
      "regulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no\r\n",
      "conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed\r\n",
      "for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any\r\n",
      "incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than\r\n",
      "usual, that John’s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had\r\n",
      "been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said,\r\n",
      "settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had\r\n",
      "taken care to secure; and when her mother died—and it was wholly\r\n",
      "improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or\r\n",
      "linger long—she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a\r\n",
      "retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from\r\n",
      "disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous\r\n",
      "world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had\r\n",
      "had. She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration.\r\n",
      "Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Georgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time\r\n",
      "in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and\r\n",
      "wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an\r\n",
      "invitation up to town. “It would be so much better,” she said, “if she\r\n",
      "could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.” I\r\n",
      "did not ask what she meant by “all being over,” but I suppose she\r\n",
      "referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of\r\n",
      "funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister’s\r\n",
      "indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had\r\n",
      "been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and\r\n",
      "unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never\r\n",
      "allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make\r\n",
      "no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a\r\n",
      "reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some\r\n",
      "other person’s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her\r\n",
      "or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out\r\n",
      "that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence\r\n",
      "for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the\r\n",
      "world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must\r\n",
      "be flattered—you must have music, dancing, and society—or you languish,\r\n",
      "you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you\r\n",
      "independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day;\r\n",
      "share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no\r\n",
      "stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes—include\r\n",
      "all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid\r\n",
      "regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has\r\n",
      "begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one\r\n",
      "vacant moment: you have had to seek no one’s company, conversation,\r\n",
      "sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent\r\n",
      "being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer\r\n",
      "you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.\r\n",
      "Neglect it—go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling—and suffer\r\n",
      "the results of your idiocy, however bad and insufferable they may be. I\r\n",
      "tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat\r\n",
      "what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my\r\n",
      "mother’s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is\r\n",
      "carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate\r\n",
      "as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we\r\n",
      "chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me\r\n",
      "down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this—if the whole human\r\n",
      "race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on\r\n",
      "the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the\r\n",
      "new.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She closed her lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,”\r\n",
      "answered Georgiana. “Everybody knows you are the most selfish,\r\n",
      "heartless creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred\r\n",
      "towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played\r\n",
      "me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you,\r\n",
      "to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show\r\n",
      "your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my\r\n",
      "prospects for ever.” Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her\r\n",
      "nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and\r\n",
      "assiduously industrious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were\r\n",
      "two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably\r\n",
      "savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy\r\n",
      "draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and\r\n",
      "husky a morsel for human deglutition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the\r\n",
      "sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a\r\n",
      "saint’s-day service at the new church—for in matters of religion she\r\n",
      "was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge\r\n",
      "of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to\r\n",
      "church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were\r\n",
      "prayers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who\r\n",
      "lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent\r\n",
      "attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out\r\n",
      "of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her\r\n",
      "own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I\r\n",
      "found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there;\r\n",
      "the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in\r\n",
      "the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel,\r\n",
      "re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze\r\n",
      "on me, and then I moved away to the window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:\r\n",
      "“One lies there,” I thought, “who will soon be beyond the war of\r\n",
      "earthly elements. Whither will that spirit—now struggling to quit its\r\n",
      "material tenement—flit when at length released?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her\r\n",
      "dying words—her faith—her doctrine of the equality of disembodied\r\n",
      "souls. I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered\r\n",
      "tones—still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face\r\n",
      "and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her\r\n",
      "longing to be restored to her divine Father’s bosom—when a feeble voice\r\n",
      "murmured from the couch behind: “Who is that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up\r\n",
      "to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is I, Aunt Reed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who—I?” was her answer. “Who are you?” looking at me with surprise and\r\n",
      "a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. “You are quite a stranger to\r\n",
      "me—where is Bessie?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is at the lodge, aunt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aunt,” she repeated. “Who calls me aunt? You are not one of the\r\n",
      "Gibsons; and yet I know you—that face, and the eyes and forehead, are\r\n",
      "quiet familiar to me: you are like—why, you are like Jane Eyre!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my\r\n",
      "identity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet,” said she, “I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.\r\n",
      "I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists:\r\n",
      "besides, in eight years she must be so changed.” I now gently assured\r\n",
      "her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing\r\n",
      "that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I\r\n",
      "explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very ill, I know,” she said ere long. “I was trying to turn\r\n",
      "myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as\r\n",
      "well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in\r\n",
      "health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the\r\n",
      "nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I assured her we were alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in\r\n",
      "breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own\r\n",
      "child; the other—” she stopped. “After all, it is of no great\r\n",
      "importance, perhaps,” she murmured to herself: “and then I may get\r\n",
      "better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed;\r\n",
      "she seemed to experience some inward sensation—the precursor, perhaps,\r\n",
      "of the last pang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell\r\n",

      "see there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus\r\n",

      "Mr. Rochester had given me but one week’s leave of absence: yet a month\r\n",
      "elapsed before I quitted Gateshead. I wished to leave immediately after\r\n",
      "the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she could get off\r\n",
      "to London, whither she was now at last invited by her uncle, Mr.\r\n",
      "Gibson, who had come down to direct his sister’s interment and settle\r\n",
      "the family affairs. Georgiana said she dreaded being left alone with\r\n",
      "Eliza; from her she got neither sympathy in her dejection, support in\r\n",
      "her fears, nor aid in her preparations; so I bore with her\r\n",
      "feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and\r\n",
      "did my best in sewing for her and packing her dresses. It is true, that\r\n",
      "while I worked, she would idle; and I thought to myself, “If you and I\r\n",
      "were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence\r\n",
      "matters on a different footing. I should not settle tamely down into\r\n",
      "being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour,\r\n",
      "and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I\r\n",
      "should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling,\r\n",
      "half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. It is only because\r\n",
      "our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly\r\n",
      "mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and\r\n",
      "compliant on my part.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza’s turn to request me\r\n",
      "to stay another week. Her plans required all her time and attention,\r\n",
      "she said; she was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day\r\n",
      "long she stayed in her own room, her door bolted within, filling\r\n",
      "trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication\r\n",
      "with any one. She wished me to look after the house, to see callers,\r\n",
      "and answer notes of condolence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning she told me I was at liberty. “And,” she added, “I am\r\n",
      "obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! There\r\n",
      "is some difference between living with such an one as you and with\r\n",
      "Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.\r\n",
      "To-morrow,” she continued, “I set out for the Continent. I shall take\r\n",
      "up my abode in a religious house near Lisle—a nunnery you would call\r\n",
      "it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested. I shall devote myself for a\r\n",
      "time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful\r\n",
      "study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half\r\n",
      "suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all\r\n",
      "things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and\r\n",
      "probably take the veil.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to\r\n",
      "dissuade her from it. “The vocation will fit you to a hair,” I thought:\r\n",
      "“much good may it do you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When we parted, she said: “Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well:\r\n",
      "you have some sense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I then returned: “You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you\r\n",
      "have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French\r\n",
      "convent. However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don’t\r\n",
      "much care.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are in the right,” said she; and with these words we each went our\r\n",
      "separate way. As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her or\r\n",
      "her sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an\r\n",
      "advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that\r\n",
      "Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the\r\n",
      "convent where she passed the period of her novitiate, and which she\r\n",
      "endowed with her fortune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or\r\n",
      "short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation. I had\r\n",
      "known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long\r\n",
      "walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was\r\n",
      "to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a\r\n",
      "good fire, and to be unable to get either. Neither of these returnings\r\n",
      "was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point,\r\n",
      "increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came. The return\r\n",
      "to Thornfield was yet to be tried.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My journey seemed tedious—very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night\r\n",
      "spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. During the first twelve\r\n",
      "hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her last moments; I saw her disfigured\r\n",
      "and discoloured face, and heard her strangely altered voice. I mused on\r\n",
      "the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and\r\n",
      "servants—few was the number of relatives—the gaping vault, the silent\r\n",
      "church, the solemn service. Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I\r\n",
      "beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a\r\n",
      "convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities\r\n",
      "of person and character. The evening arrival at the great town of ——\r\n",
      "scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down\r\n",
      "on my traveller’s bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there? Not\r\n",
      "long; of that I was sure. I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim\r\n",
      "of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had\r\n",
      "left for London three weeks ago, but he was then expected to return in\r\n",
      "a fortnight. Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he was gone to make\r\n",
      "arrangements for his wedding, as he had talked of purchasing a new\r\n",
      "carriage: she said the idea of his marrying Miss Ingram still seemed\r\n",
      "strange to her; but from what everybody said, and from what she had\r\n",
      "herself seen, she could no longer doubt that the event would shortly\r\n",
      "take place. “You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,”\r\n",
      "was my mental comment. “I don’t doubt it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The question followed, “Where was I to go?” I dreamt of Miss Ingram all\r\n",
      "the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her closing the gates of\r\n",
      "Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester looked on with his arms folded—smiling sardonically, as it\r\n",
      "seemed, at both her and me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I\r\n",
      "did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote. I proposed\r\n",
      "to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving\r\n",
      "my box in the ostler’s care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about\r\n",
      "six o’clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a\r\n",
      "road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft:\r\n",
      "the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far\r\n",
      "from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its\r\n",
      "blue—where blue was visible—was mild and settled, and its cloud strata\r\n",
      "high and thin. The west, too, was warm: no watery gleam chilled it—it\r\n",
      "seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen\r\n",
      "of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped\r\n",
      "once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it\r\n",
      "was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to\r\n",
      "a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.\r\n",
      "“Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,” said I; “and\r\n",
      "little Adèle will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very\r\n",
      "well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking\r\n",
      "of you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience?\r\n",
      "These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of\r\n",
      "again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he looked on me or not; and\r\n",
      "they added—“Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more\r\n",
      "days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!” And then\r\n",
      "I strangled a new-born agony—a deformed thing which I could not\r\n",
      "persuade myself to own and rear—and ran on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the\r\n",
      "labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their\r\n",
      "rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive. I have but a field\r\n",
      "or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the\r\n",
      "gates. How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather\r\n",
      "any; I want to be at the house. I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy\r\n",
      "and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone\r\n",
      "steps; and I see—Mr. Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in\r\n",
      "his hand; he is writing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, he is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a\r\n",
      "moment I am beyond my own mastery. What does it mean? I did not think I\r\n",
      "should tremble in this way when I saw him, or lose my voice or the\r\n",
      "power of motion in his presence. I will go back as soon as I can stir:\r\n",
      "I need not make an absolute fool of myself. I know another way to the\r\n",
      "house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he has seen me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hillo!” he cries; and he puts up his book and his pencil. “There you\r\n",
      "are! Come on, if you please.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being\r\n",
      "scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm;\r\n",
      "and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face—which I feel\r\n",
      "rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had\r\n",
      "resolved to conceal. But I have a veil—it is down: I may make shift yet\r\n",
      "to behave with decent composure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this is Jane Eyre? Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot?\r\n",
      "Yes—just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come\r\n",
      "clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into\r\n",
      "the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a\r\n",
      "dream or a shade. What the deuce have you done with yourself this last\r\n",
      "month?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "world—from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she\r\n",
      "meets me alone here in the gloaming! If I dared, I’d touch you, to see\r\n",
      "if you are substance or shadow, you elf!—but I’d as soon offer to take\r\n",
      "hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh. Truant! truant!” he\r\n",
      "added, when he had paused an instant. “Absent from me a whole month,\r\n",
      "and forgetting me quite, I’ll be sworn!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though\r\n",
      "broken by the fear that he was so soon to cease to be my master, and by\r\n",
      "the knowledge that I was nothing to him: but there was ever in Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester (so at least I thought) such a wealth of the power of\r\n",
      "communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he scattered\r\n",
      "to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially. His last\r\n",
      "words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him\r\n",
      "whether I forgot him or not. And he had spoken of Thornfield as my\r\n",
      "home—would that it were my home!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by. I\r\n",
      "inquired soon if he had not been to London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won’t look like Queen\r\n",
      "Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions. I wish, Jane, I\r\n",
      "were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally. Tell me now,\r\n",
      "fairy as you are—can’t you give me a charm, or a philter, or something\r\n",
      "of that sort, to make me a handsome man?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would be past the power of magic, sir;” and, in thought, I added,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to\r\n",
      "me incomprehensible: in the present instance he took no notice of my\r\n",
      "abrupt vocal response; but he smiled at me with a certain smile he had\r\n",
      "of his own, and which he used but on rare occasions. He seemed to think\r\n",
      "it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling—he\r\n",
      "shed it over me now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pass, Janet,” said he, making room for me to cross the stile: “go up\r\n",
      "home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend’s\r\n",
      "threshold.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All I had now to do was to obey him in silence: no need for me to\r\n",
      "colloquise further. I got over the stile without a word, and meant to\r\n",
      "leave him calmly. An impulse held me fast—a force turned me round. I\r\n",
      "said—or something in me said for me, and in spite of me—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness. I am strangely glad\r\n",

      "home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I walked on so fast that even he could hardly have overtaken me had he\r\n",

      "Fairfax received me with her usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and\r\n",
      "even Sophie bid me “bon soir” with glee. This was very pleasant; there\r\n",

      "feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my\r\n",
      "ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and\r\n",
      "coming grief. When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her\r\n",
      "knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her, and Adèle, kneeling on\r\n",
      "the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection\r\n",
      "seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent\r\n",
      "prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus\r\n",
      "sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to\r\n",
      "take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable—when he said he\r\n",
      "supposed the old lady was all right now that she had got her adopted\r\n",
      "daughter back again, and added that he saw Adèle was “prête à croquer\r\n",
      "sa petite maman Anglaise”—I half ventured to hope that he would, even\r\n",
      "after his marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his\r\n",
      "protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his presence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall.\r\n",
      "Nothing was said of the master’s marriage, and I saw no preparation\r\n",
      "going on for such an event. Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if\r\n",
      "she had yet heard anything decided: her answer was always in the\r\n",
      "negative. Once she said she had actually put the question to Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester as to when he was going to bring his bride home; but he had\r\n",
      "answered her only by a joke and one of his queer looks, and she could\r\n",
      "not tell what to make of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no\r\n",
      "journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure\r\n",
      "it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was\r\n",
      "that distance to an ardent lover? To so practised and indefatigable a\r\n",
      "horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning’s ride. I began to\r\n",
      "cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken\r\n",
      "off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had\r\n",
      "changed their minds. I used to look at my master’s face to see if it\r\n",
      "were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been\r\n",
      "so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings. If, in the moments I and\r\n",
      "my pupil spent with him, I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable\r\n",
      "dejection, he became even gay. Never had he called me more frequently\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant\r\n",
      "as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our\r\n",
      "wave-girt land. It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the\r\n",
      "South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest\r\n",
      "them on the cliffs of Albion. The hay was all got in; the fields round\r\n",
      "Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees\r\n",
      "were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply\r\n",
      "tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows\r\n",
      "between.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Midsummer-eve, Adèle, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay\r\n",
      "Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun. I watched her drop\r\n",
      "asleep, and when I left her, I sought the garden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:—“Day its fervid fires\r\n",
      "had wasted,” and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.\r\n",
      "Where the sun had gone down in simple state—pure of the pomp of\r\n",
      "clouds—spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and\r\n",
      "furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and\r\n",
      "wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven. The east had its own\r\n",
      "charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a rising and solitary\r\n",
      "star: soon it would boast the moon; but she was yet beneath the\r\n",
      "horizon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent—that\r\n",
      "of a cigar—stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a\r\n",
      "handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the\r\n",
      "orchard. No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it\r\n",
      "was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it\r\n",
      "out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened\r\n",
      "it from the lawn. At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation\r\n",
      "from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and\r\n",
      "terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat,\r\n",
      "led down to the fence. Here one could wander unseen. While such\r\n",
      "honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as\r\n",
      "if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and\r\n",
      "fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by\r\n",
      "the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step\r\n",
      "is stayed—not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning\r\n",
      "fragrance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been\r\n",
      "yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither\r\n",
      "of shrub nor flower; it is—I know it well—it is Mr. Rochester’s cigar.\r\n",
      "I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit. I\r\n",
      "hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form\r\n",
      "is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must\r\n",
      "flee. I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester entering. I step aside into the ivy recess; he will not stay\r\n",
      "long: he will soon return whence he came, and if I sit still he will\r\n",
      "never see me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no—eventide is as pleasant to him as to me, and this antique garden\r\n",
      "as attractive; and he strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree\r\n",
      "branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are\r\n",
      "laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a\r\n",
      "knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the\r\n",
      "dew-beads on their petals. A great moth goes humming by me; it alights\r\n",
      "on a plant at Mr. Rochester’s foot: he sees it, and bends to examine\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, he has his back towards me,” thought I, “and he is occupied too;\r\n",
      "perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel\r\n",
      "might not betray me: he was standing among the beds at a yard or two\r\n",
      "distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him. “I\r\n",
      "shall get by very well,” I meditated. As I crossed his shadow, thrown\r\n",
      "long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he said quietly,\r\n",
      "without turning—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, come and look at this fellow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had made no noise: he had not eyes behind—could his shadow feel? I\r\n",
      "started at first, and then I approached him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look at his wings,” said he, “he reminds me rather of a West Indian\r\n",
      "insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in\r\n",
      "England; there! he is flown.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The moth roamed away. I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and\r\n",
      "surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting\r\n",
      "with moonrise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt\r\n",
      "enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing\r\n",
      "an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile\r\n",
      "word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful\r\n",
      "embarrassment. I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to\r\n",
      "allege for leaving him. I followed with lagging step, and thoughts\r\n",
      "busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he himself\r\n",
      "looked so composed and so grave also, I became ashamed of feeling any\r\n",
      "confusion: the evil—if evil existent or prospective there was—seemed to\r\n",
      "lie with me only; his mind was unconscious and quiet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane,” he recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly\r\n",
      "strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut,\r\n",
      "“Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must have become in some degree attached to the house,—you, who\r\n",
      "have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of\r\n",
      "Adhesiveness?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am attached to it, indeed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And though I don’t comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired\r\n",
      "a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adèle, too; and even\r\n",
      "for simple dame Fairfax?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And would be sorry to part with them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pity!” he said, and sighed and paused. “It is always the way of events\r\n",
      "in this life,” he continued presently: “no sooner have you got settled\r\n",
      "in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and\r\n",
      "move on, for the hour of repose is expired.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Must I move on, sir?” I asked. “Must I leave Thornfield?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you\r\n",
      "must.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is come now—I must give it to-night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ex-act-ly—pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the\r\n",
      "nail straight on the head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Soon, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very soon, my—that is, Miss Eyre: and you’ll remember, Jane, the first\r\n",
      "time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to\r\n",
      "put my old bachelor’s neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the\r\n",
      "holy estate of matrimony—to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short\r\n",
      "(she’s an extensive armful: but that’s not to the point—one can’t have\r\n",
      "too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well,\r\n",
      "as I was saying—listen to me, Jane! You’re not turning your head to\r\n",
      "look after more moths, are you? That was only a lady-clock, child,\r\n",
      "‘flying away home.’ I wish to remind you that it was you who first said\r\n",
      "to me, with that discretion I respect in you—with that foresight,\r\n",
      "prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent\r\n",
      "position—that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adèle\r\n",
      "had better trot forthwith. I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in\r\n",
      "this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are\r\n",
      "far away, Janet, I’ll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom;\r\n",
      "which is such that I have made it my law of action. Adèle must go to\r\n",
      "school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose—” I\r\n",
      "was going to say, “I suppose I may stay here, till I find another\r\n",
      "shelter to betake myself to:” but I stopped, feeling it would not do to\r\n",
      "risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,” continued Mr. Rochester;\r\n",
      "“and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an\r\n",
      "asylum for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no need to apologise! I consider that when a dependent does her\r\n",
      "duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her\r\n",
      "employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her;\r\n",
      "indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a\r\n",
      "place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the\r\n",
      "five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O’Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\r\n",
      "Ireland. You’ll like Ireland, I think: they’re such warm-hearted people\r\n",
      "there, they say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a long way off, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No matter—a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the\r\n",
      "distance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From England and from Thornfield: and—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“From _you_, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free\r\n",
      "will, my tears gushed out. I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I\r\n",
      "avoided sobbing. The thought of Mrs. O’Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck\r\n",
      "cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam,\r\n",
      "destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side\r\n",
      "I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean—wealth,\r\n",
      "caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably\r\n",
      "loved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a long way,” I again said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught,\r\n",
      "Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that’s morally certain. I\r\n",
      "never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the\r\n",
      "country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the\r\n",
      "little time that remains to them close to each other. Come! we’ll talk\r\n",
      "over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the\r\n",
      "stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the\r\n",
      "chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots. Come, we will sit\r\n",
      "there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit\r\n",
      "there together.” He seated me and himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little\r\n",
      "friend on such weary travels: but if I can’t do better, how is it to be\r\n",
      "helped? Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because,” he said, “I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to\r\n",
      "you—especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string\r\n",
      "somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a\r\n",
      "similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little\r\n",
      "frame. And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of\r\n",
      "land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be\r\n",
      "snapt; and then I’ve a nervous notion I should take to bleeding\r\n",
      "inwardly. As for you,—you’d forget me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That I _never_ should, sir: you know—” Impossible to proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood? Listen!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured\r\n",
      "no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot\r\n",
      "with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an\r\n",
      "impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because you are sorry to leave it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was\r\n",
      "claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right\r\n",
      "to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,—and\r\n",
      "to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:—I love it, because I\r\n",
      "have lived in it a full and delightful life,—momentarily at least. I\r\n",
      "have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified. I have not been\r\n",
      "buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of\r\n",
      "communion with what is bright and energetic and high. I have talked,\r\n",
      "face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,—with an\r\n",
      "original, a vigorous, an expanded mind. I have known you, Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I\r\n",
      "absolutely must be torn from you for ever. I see the necessity of\r\n",
      "departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where do you see the necessity?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In what shape?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,—your bride.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My bride! What bride? I have no bride!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you will have.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes;—I will!—I will!” He set his teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then I must go:—you have said it yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No: you must stay! I swear it—and the oath shall be kept.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you I must go!” I retorted, roused to something like passion.\r\n",
      "“Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you? Do you think I am an\r\n",
      "automaton?—a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel\r\n",
      "of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from\r\n",
      "my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I\r\n",
      "am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!—I have as much soul as\r\n",
      "you,—and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty\r\n",
      "and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as\r\n",
      "it is now for me to leave you. I am not talking to you now through the\r\n",
      "medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;—it is my\r\n",
      "spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through\r\n",
      "the grave, and we stood at God’s feet, equal,—as we are!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As we are!” repeated Mr. Rochester—“so,” he added, enclosing me in his\r\n",
      "arms, gathering me to his breast, pressing his lips on my lips: “so,\r\n",
      "Jane!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, so, sir,” I rejoined: “and yet not so; for you are a married\r\n",
      "man—or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you—to one\r\n",
      "with whom you have no sympathy—whom I do not believe you truly love;\r\n",
      "for I have seen and heard you sneer at her. I would scorn such a union:\r\n",
      "therefore I am better than you—let me go!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where, Jane? To Ireland?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—to Ireland. I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, be still; don’t struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is\r\n",
      "rending its own plumage in its desperation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an\r\n",
      "independent will, which I now exert to leave you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another effort set me at liberty, and I stood erect before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your will shall decide your destiny,” he said: “I offer you my\r\n",
      "hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I ask you to pass through life at my side—to be my second self, and\r\n",
      "best earthly companion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by\r\n",
      "it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through\r\n",
      "the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away—away—to an indefinite\r\n",
      "distance—it died. The nightingale’s song was then the only voice of the\r\n",
      "hour: in listening to it, I again wept. Mr. Rochester sat quiet,\r\n",
      "looking at me gently and seriously. Some time passed before he spoke;\r\n",
      "he at last said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot\r\n",
      "return.”\r\n",

      "“But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was silent: I thought he mocked me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, Jane—come hither.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your bride stands between us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose, and with a stride reached me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My bride is here,” he said, again drawing me to him, “because my equal\r\n",
      "is here, and my likeness. Jane, will you marry me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his grasp: for\r\n",
      "I was still incredulous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "_shall_ be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that\r\n",
      "you know. What love has she for me? None: as I have taken pains to\r\n",
      "prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third\r\n",
      "of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the\r\n",
      "result; it was coldness both from her and her mother. I would not—I\r\n",
      "could not—marry Miss Ingram. You—you strange, you almost unearthly\r\n",
      "thing!—I love as my own flesh. You—poor and obscure, and small and\r\n",
      "plain as you are—I entreat to accept me as a husband.”\r\n",

      "have given me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished. She put\r\n",

      "and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my\r\n",

      "actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him? Don’t\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I\r\n",
      "daresay, is fond of you. I have always noticed that you were a sort of\r\n",
      "pet of his. There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little\r\n",
      "uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your\r\n",
      "guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong. I\r\n",
      "knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so\r\n",
      "discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be\r\n",
      "trusted to protect yourself. Last night I cannot tell you what I\r\n",
      "suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere,\r\n",
      "nor the master either; and then, at twelve o’clock, saw you come in\r\n",
      "with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I hope all will be right in the end,” she said: “but believe me, you\r\n",
      "cannot be too careful. Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance:\r\n",
      "distrust yourself as well as him. Gentlemen in his station are not\r\n",
      "accustomed to marry their governesses.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go,—let me go to Millcote too!” she cried. “Mr. Rochester\r\n",
      "won’t: though there is so much room in the new carriage. Beg him to let\r\n",
      "me go, mademoiselle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That I will, Adèle;” and I hastened away with her, glad to quit my\r\n",

      "“Not it: she will be a restraint.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was quite peremptory, both in look and voice. The chill of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Fairfax’s warnings, and the damp of her doubts were upon me: something\r\n",
      "of unsubstantiality and uncertainty had beset my hopes. I half lost the\r\n",
      "sense of power over him. I was about mechanically to obey him, without\r\n",
      "further remonstrance; but as he helped me into the carriage, he looked\r\n",
      "at my face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "he, “when I mean shortly to claim you—your thoughts, conversation, and\r\n",
      "company—for life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle, when lifted in, commenced kissing me, by way of expressing her\r\n",
      "gratitude for my intercession: she was instantly stowed away into a\r\n",
      "corner on the other side of him. She then peeped round to where I sat;\r\n",
      "so stern a neighbour was too restrictive: to him, in his present\r\n",
      "fractious mood, she dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him any\r\n",
      "information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let her come to me,” I entreated: “she will, perhaps, trouble you,\r\n",
      "sir: there is plenty of room on this side.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He handed her over as if she had been a lapdog. “I’ll send her to\r\n",
      "school yet,” he said, but now he was smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Adèle heard him, and asked if she was to go to school “sans\r\n",
      "mademoiselle?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” he replied, “absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take\r\n",
      "mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the\r\n",
      "white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with\r\n",
      "me there, and only me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,” observed Adèle.\r\n",

      "“Oh, qu’elle y sera mal—peu comfortable! And her clothes, they will\r\n",
      "wear out: how can she get new ones?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester professed to be puzzled. “Hem!” said he. “What would you\r\n",
      "do, Adèle? Cudgel your brains for an expedient. How would a white or a\r\n",
      "pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think? And one could cut a pretty\r\n",
      "enough scarf out of a rainbow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is far better as she is,” concluded Adèle, after musing some time:\r\n",

      "“She has consented: she has pledged her word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you can’t get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all\r\n",
      "air; and neither you nor she can fly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Adèle, look at that field.” We were now outside Thornfield gates, and\r\n",
      "bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was\r\n",
      "well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty\r\n",
      "timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In that field, Adèle, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight\r\n",
      "since—the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard\r\n",
      "meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me\r\n",
      "on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began\r\n",
      "to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had\r\n",
      "for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight\r\n",
      "was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped\r\n",
      "two yards off me. I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of\r\n",
      "gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at\r\n",
      "my knee. I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I\r\n",
      "read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to\r\n",
      "this effect—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to\r\n",
      "make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely\r\n",
      "place—such as the moon, for instance—and it nodded its head towards her\r\n",
      "horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver\r\n",
      "vale where we might live. I said I should like to go; but reminded it,\r\n",
      "as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“‘Oh,’ returned the fairy, ‘that does not signify! Here is a talisman\r\n",
      "will remove all difficulties;’ and she held out a pretty gold ring.\r\n",
      "‘Put it,’ she said, ‘on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am\r\n",
      "yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own\r\n",
      "heaven yonder.’ She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adèle, is in my\r\n",
      "breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to\r\n",
      "change it to a ring again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don’t care for the fairy:\r\n",
      "you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mademoiselle is a fairy,” he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon\r\n",
      "I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a\r\n",
      "fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester “un vrai\r\n",
      "menteur,” and assuring him that she made no account whatever of his\r\n",
      "“contes de fée,” and that “du reste, il n’y avait pas de fées, et quand\r\n",
      "même il y en avait:” she was sure they would never appear to him, nor\r\n",
      "ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was\r\n",
      "ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged\r\n",
      "leave to defer it: no—it should be gone through with now. By dint of\r\n",
      "entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to\r\n",
      "two: these however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I\r\n",
      "watched his eye rove over the gay stores: he fixed on a rich silk of\r\n",
      "the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin. I told him in\r\n",
      "a new series of whispers, that he might as well buy me a gold gown and\r\n",
      "a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his\r\n",
      "choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I\r\n",
      "persuaded him to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and\r\n",
      "pearl-grey silk. “It might pass for the present,” he said; “but he\r\n",
      "would yet see me glittering like a parterre.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glad was I to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a\r\n",
      "jeweller’s shop: the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a\r\n",
      "sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the carriage, and\r\n",
      "I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of\r\n",
      "events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten—the letter of my uncle,\r\n",
      "John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his intention to adopt me and make me his\r\n",
      "legatee. “It would, indeed, be a relief,” I thought, “if I had ever so\r\n",
      "small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower\r\n",
      "falling daily round me. I will write to Madeira the moment I get home,\r\n",
      "and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had\r\n",
      "but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of\r\n",
      "fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.” And somewhat\r\n",
      "relieved by this idea (which I failed not to execute that day), I\r\n",
      "ventured once more to meet my master’s and lover’s eye, which most\r\n",
      "pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze. He\r\n",
      "smiled; and I thought his smile was such as a sultan might, in a\r\n",
      "blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his gold and gems had\r\n",
      "enriched: I crushed his hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously,\r\n",
      "and thrust it back to him red with the passionate pressure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not look in that way,” I said; “if you do, I’ll wear nothing\r\n",
      "but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter. I’ll be married in\r\n",
      "this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of\r\n",
      "the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the\r\n",
      "black satin.”\r\n",

      "The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being\r\n",
      "numbered. There was no putting off the day that advanced—the bridal\r\n",
      "day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. _I_, at least,\r\n",
      "had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded,\r\n",
      "ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this\r\n",
      "time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I\r\n",
      "(D.V.),—or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person whom as yet\r\n",
      "I knew not. The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay,\r\n",
      "four little squares, in the drawer. Mr. Rochester had himself written\r\n",
      "the direction, “Mrs. Rochester, —— Hotel, London,” on each: I could not\r\n",
      "persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed. Mrs. Rochester!\r\n",
      "She did not exist: she would not be born till to-morrow, some time\r\n",
      "after eight o’clock A.M.; and I would wait to be assured she had come\r\n",
      "into the world alive before I assigned to her all that property. It was\r\n",
      "enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said\r\n",
      "to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw\r\n",
      "bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the\r\n",
      "pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped\r\n",
      "portmanteau. I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like\r\n",
      "apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour—nine o’clock—gave out\r\n",
      "certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment. “I\r\n",
      "will leave you by yourself, white dream,” I said. “I am feverish: I\r\n",

      "It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not\r\n",
      "only the anticipation of the great change—the new life which was to\r\n",
      "commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share,\r\n",
      "doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me\r\n",
      "forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause\r\n",
      "influenced my mind more than they.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had at heart a strange and anxious thought. Something had happened\r\n",
      "which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but\r\n",
      "myself: it had taken place the preceding night. Mr. Rochester that\r\n",
      "night was absent from home; nor was he yet returned: business had\r\n",
      "called him to a small estate of two or three farms he possessed thirty\r\n",
      "miles off—business it was requisite he should settle in person,\r\n",
      "previous to his meditated departure from England. I waited now his\r\n",
      "return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him the solution of\r\n",
      "the enigma that perplexed me. Stay till he comes, reader; and, when I\r\n",
      "disclose my secret to him, you shall share the confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day\r\n",
      "had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a\r\n",
      "speck of rain. Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to\r\n",
      "augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one\r\n",
      "way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once\r\n",
      "in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads\r\n",
      "northward—the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on\r\n",
      "mass: no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day.\r\n",

      "It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind,\r\n",
      "delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering\r\n",
      "through space. Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the\r\n",
      "chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the\r\n",
      "centre, gasped ghastly. The cloven halves were not broken from each\r\n",
      "other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below;\r\n",
      "though community of vitality was destroyed—the sap could flow no more:\r\n",
      "their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter’s tempests\r\n",
      "would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might\r\n",
      "be said to form one tree—a ruin, but an entire ruin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You did right to hold fast to each other,” I said: as if the\r\n",
      "monster-splinters were living things, and could hear me. “I think,\r\n",
      "scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little\r\n",
      "sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful,\r\n",
      "honest roots: you will never have green leaves more—never more see\r\n",
      "birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of\r\n",
      "pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of\r\n",
      "you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.” As I looked up\r\n",
      "at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which\r\n",
      "filled their fissure; her disk was blood-red and half overcast; she\r\n",
      "seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself\r\n",
      "again instantly in the deep drift of cloud. The wind fell, for a\r\n",
      "second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a\r\n",
      "wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.\r\n",

      "Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples\r\n",
      "with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I\r\n",
      "employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them\r\n",
      "into the house and put them away in the store-room. Then I repaired to\r\n",
      "the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer,\r\n",
      "I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a\r\n",
      "cheerful hearth when he came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some\r\n",
      "time, and burnt well. I placed his arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I\r\n",
      "wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles\r\n",
      "brought in ready for lighting. More restless than ever, when I had\r\n",
      "completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in\r\n",
      "the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the\r\n",
      "hall simultaneously struck ten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How late it grows!” I said. “I will run down to the gates: it is\r\n",
      "moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road. He may be\r\n",
      "coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but\r\n",
      "the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all\r\n",
      "still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at\r\n",
      "intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried\r\n",
      "by one moving speck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked—a tear of disappointment\r\n",
      "and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away. I lingered; the moon\r\n",
      "shut herself wholly within her chamber, and drew close her curtain of\r\n",
      "dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish he would come! I wish he would come!” I exclaimed, seized with\r\n",
      "hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his arrival before tea; now it\r\n",
      "was dark: what could keep him? Had an accident happened? The event of\r\n",
      "last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of\r\n",
      "disaster. I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had\r\n",
      "enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its\r\n",
      "meridian, and must now decline.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I cannot return to the house,” I thought; “I cannot sit by the\r\n",
      "fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs\r\n",
      "than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of\r\n",
      "a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a\r\n",
      "dog ran by his side. Away with evil presentiment! It was he: here he\r\n",
      "was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. He saw me; for the moon had\r\n",
      "opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he took\r\n",
      "his hat off, and waved it round his head. I now ran to meet him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There!” he exclaimed, as he stretched out his hand and bent from the\r\n",
      "saddle: “You can’t do without me, that is evident. Step on my boot-toe;\r\n",
      "give me both hands: mount!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him. A hearty kissing I\r\n",
      "got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well\r\n",
      "as I could. He checked himself in his exultation to demand, “But is\r\n",
      "there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an\r\n",
      "hour? Is there anything wrong?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in\r\n",
      "the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rain and wind, indeed! Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my\r\n",
      "cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek\r\n",
      "and hand are burning hot. I ask again, is there anything the matter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you have been both?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rather: but I’ll tell you all about it by-and-by, sir; and I daresay\r\n",
      "you will only laugh at me for my pains.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare\r\n",
      "not: my prize is not certain. This is you, who have been as slippery as\r\n",
      "an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay\r\n",
      "a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up\r\n",
      "a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your\r\n",
      "shepherd, did you, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted you: but don’t boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me\r\n",
      "get down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He landed me on the pavement. As John took his horse, and he followed\r\n",
      "me into the hall, he told me to make haste and put something dry on,\r\n",
      "and then return to him in the library; and he stopped me, as I made for\r\n",
      "the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I\r\n",
      "long; in five minutes I rejoined him. I found him at supper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal\r\n",
      "but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down near him, but told him I could not eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane? Is\r\n",
      "it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know\r\n",
      "what thoughts I have in my head. Everything in life seems unreal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Except me: I am substantial enough—touch me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He held out his hand, laughing. “Is that a dream?” said he, placing it\r\n",
      "close to my eyes. He had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as\r\n",
      "well as a long, strong arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,” said I, as I put it down from\r\n",
      "before my face. “Sir, have you finished supper?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I\r\n",
      "stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master’s knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is near midnight,” I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before\r\n",
      "my wedding.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have\r\n",
      "no wish to go to bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are all your arrangements complete?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And on my part likewise,” he returned, “I have settled everything; and\r\n",

      "return from church.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word—‘very well,’\r\n",
      "Jane! What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how\r\n",
      "strangely your eyes glitter! Are you well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe I am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Believe! What is the matter? Tell me what you feel.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel. I wish this\r\n",
      "present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may\r\n",
      "come charged?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is hypochondria, Jane. You have been over-excited, or\r\n",
      "over-fatigued.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Calm?—no: but happy—to the heart’s core.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked up at him to read the signs of bliss in his face: it was\r\n",
      "ardent and flushed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me your confidence, Jane,” he said: “relieve your mind of any\r\n",
      "weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me. What do you fear?—that\r\n",
      "I shall not prove a good husband?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?—of the\r\n",
      "new life into which you are passing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex\r\n",
      "and pain me. I want an explanation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then, sir, listen. You were from home last night?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had\r\n",
      "happened in my absence:—nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in\r\n",
      "short, it has disturbed you. Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said\r\n",
      "something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?—your\r\n",
      "sensitive self-respect has been wounded?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir.” It struck twelve—I waited till the time-piece had concluded\r\n",
      "its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then\r\n",
      "I proceeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless\r\n",
      "bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting\r\n",
      "fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to\r\n",
      "have the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don’t\r\n",
      "caress me now—let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in\r\n",
      "Providence, and believed that events were working together for your\r\n",
      "good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect—the calmness of the\r\n",
      "air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on\r\n",
      "your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea,\r\n",
      "thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely\r\n",
      "missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before\r\n",
      "me—_your_ life, sir—an existence more expansive and stirring than my\r\n",
      "own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs\r\n",
      "are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why\r\n",
      "moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like\r\n",
      "a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went\r\n",
      "in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they\r\n",
      "had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present—the veil\r\n",
      "which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London:\r\n",
      "resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into\r\n",
      "accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised\r\n",
      "how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts\r\n",
      "to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought\r\n",
      "how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had\r\n",
      "myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was\r\n",
      "not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither\r\n",
      "fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and\r\n",
      "heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of\r\n",
      "any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your\r\n",
      "standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How well you read me, you witch!” interposed Mr. Rochester: “but what\r\n",
      "did you find in the veil besides its embroidery? Did you find poison,\r\n",
      "or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found\r\n",
      "nothing save Fairfax Rochester’s pride; and that did not scare me,\r\n",
      "because I am used to the sight of the demon. But, sir, as it grew dark,\r\n",
      "the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now—wild and\r\n",
      "high—but ‘with a sullen, moaning sound’ far more eerie. I wished you\r\n",
      "were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair\r\n",
      "and fireless hearth chilled me. For some time after I went to bed, I\r\n",
      "could not sleep—a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. The gale\r\n",
      "still rising seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound;\r\n",
      "whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it\r\n",
      "recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it\r\n",
      "must be some dog howling at a distance. I was glad when it ceased. On\r\n",
      "sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I\r\n",
      "continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange,\r\n",
      "regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us. During all my\r\n",
      "first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total\r\n",
      "obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge\r\n",
      "of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk,\r\n",
      "and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear. I\r\n",
      "thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I\r\n",
      "strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to\r\n",
      "utter your name and entreat you to stop—but my movements were fettered,\r\n",
      "and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew\r\n",
      "farther and farther every moment.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to\r\n",
      "you? Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of\r\n",
      "real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes—I will not forget that;\r\n",
      "and you cannot deny it. _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your\r\n",
      "lips. I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but\r\n",
      "sweet as music—‘I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of\r\n",
      "living with you, Edward, because I love you.’ Do you love me,\r\n",
      "Jane?—repeat it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do, sir—I do, with my whole heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” he said, after some minutes’ silence, “it is strange; but that\r\n",
      "sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? I think because you\r\n",
      "said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward\r\n",
      "gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is\r\n",
      "too much as if some spirit were near me. Look wicked, Jane: as you know\r\n",
      "well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me\r\n",
      "you hate me—tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather\r\n",
      "be incensed than saddened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will tease you and vex you to your heart’s content, when I have\r\n",
      "finished my tale: but hear me to the end.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source\r\n",
      "of your melancholy in a dream.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shook my head. “What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be\r\n",
      "anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand. Go on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The disquietude of his air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his\r\n",
      "manner, surprised me: but I proceeded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin,\r\n",
      "the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front\r\n",
      "nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very\r\n",
      "fragile-looking. I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the\r\n",
      "grass-grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and\r\n",
      "there over a fallen fragment of cornice. Wrapped up in a shawl, I still\r\n",
      "carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere,\r\n",
      "however tired were my arms—however much its weight impeded my progress,\r\n",
      "I must retain it. I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the\r\n",
      "road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and\r\n",
      "for a distant country. I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous\r\n",
      "haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones\r\n",
      "rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the\r\n",
      "child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I\r\n",
      "gained the summit. I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening\r\n",
      "every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand. I sat down on\r\n",
      "the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an\r\n",
      "angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall\r\n",
      "crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my\r\n",
      "balance, fell, and woke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now, Jane, that is all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam\r\n",
      "dazzled my eyes; I thought—Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it\r\n",
      "was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. There was a\r\n",
      "light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before\r\n",
      "going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard\r\n",
      "a rustling there. I asked, ‘Sophie, what are you doing?’ No one\r\n",
      "answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held\r\n",
      "it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.\r\n",
      "‘Sophie! Sophie!’ I again cried: and still it was silent. I had risen\r\n",
      "up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over\r\n",
      "me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins. Mr. Rochester, this\r\n",
      "was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was\r\n",
      "not—no, I was sure of it, and am still—it was not even that strange\r\n",
      "woman, Grace Poole.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must have been one of them,” interrupted my master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. The shape standing\r\n",
      "before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield\r\n",
      "Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Describe it, Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair\r\n",
      "hanging long down her back. I know not what dress she had on: it was\r\n",
      "white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you see her face?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at first. But presently she took my veil from its place; she held\r\n",
      "it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and\r\n",
      "turned to the mirror. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage\r\n",
      "and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And how were they?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fearful and ghastly to me—oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was\r\n",
      "a discoloured face—it was a savage face. I wish I could forget the roll\r\n",

      "usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger. “Jane!”\r\n",
      "called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising\r\n",
      "calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy\r\n",
      "morning sky beyond. I remember something, too, of the green\r\n",
      "grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of\r\n",
      "strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes\r\n",
      "graven on the few mossy head-stones. I noticed them, because, as they\r\n",
      "saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not\r\n",
      "they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the\r\n",
      "ceremony. By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he was earnestly\r\n",
      "looking at my face, from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily\r\n",
      "fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold. When I\r\n",
      "rallied, which I soon did, he walked gently with me up the path to the\r\n",
      "porch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his white\r\n",

      "shadows only moved in a remote corner. My conjecture had been correct:\r\n",
      "the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault\r\n",
      "of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails\r\n",
      "the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the\r\n",
      "remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the\r\n",
      "civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our place was taken at the communion rails. Hearing a cautious step\r\n",
      "behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers—a\r\n",
      "gentleman, evidently—was advancing up the chancel. The service began.\r\n",
      "The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then\r\n",
      "the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Rochester, went on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day\r\n",
      "of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that\r\n",
      "if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined\r\n",
      "together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured\r\n",
      "that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God’s Word doth\r\n",
      "allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony\r\n",
      "lawful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever\r\n",
      "broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years. And the\r\n",
      "clergyman, who had not lifted his eyes from his book, and had held his\r\n",
      "breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his hand was already stretched\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Rochester, as his lips unclosed to ask, “Wilt thou have\r\n",
      "this woman for thy wedded wife?”—when a distinct and near voice said—\r\n",

      "“The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.”\r\n",

      "the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled\r\n",
      "under his feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his head or\r\n",
      "eyes, he said, “Proceed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Profound silence fell when he had uttered that word, with deep but low\r\n",
      "intonation. Presently Mr. Wood said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "this marriage exists.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he stood stubborn and rigid,\r\n",
      "making no movement but to possess himself of my hand. What a hot and\r\n",
      "strong grasp he had! and how like quarried marble was his pale, firm,\r\n",
      "massive front at this moment! How his eye shone, still watchful, and\r\n",
      "yet wild beneath!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. “What is the nature of the impediment?” he\r\n",
      "asked. “Perhaps it may be got over—explained away?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hardly,” was the answer. “I have called it insuperable, and I speak\r\n",
      "advisedly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails. He continued,\r\n",
      "uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage. Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester has a wife now living.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated\r\n",
      "to thunder—my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt\r\n",
      "frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning. I\r\n",
      "looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him look at me. His whole face was\r\n",
      "colourless rock: his eye was both spark and flint. He disavowed\r\n",
      "nothing: he seemed as if he would defy all things. Without speaking,\r\n",
      "without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he\r\n",
      "only twined my waist with his arm and riveted me to his side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who are you?” he asked of the intruder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My name is Briggs, a solicitor of —— Street, London.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "place of abode.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly.” Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his pocket, and read\r\n",
      "out in a sort of official, nasal voice:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“‘I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. —— (a date of\r\n",

      "the county of ——, and of Ferndean Manor, in ——shire, England, was\r\n",
      "married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason,\r\n",

      "a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him as I was, I felt the\r\n",
      "spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his frame. The second\r\n",
      "stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a\r\n",
      "pale face looked over the solicitor’s shoulder—yes, it was Mason\r\n",
      "himself. Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him. His eye, as I have\r\n",
      "often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in\r\n",
      "its gloom; and his face flushed—olive cheek and hueless forehead\r\n",
      "received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he\r\n",
      "stirred, lifted his strong arm—he could have struck Mason, dashed him\r\n",
      "on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his\r\n",
      "body—but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, “Good God!” Contempt\r\n",
      "fell cool on Mr. Rochester—his passion died as if a blight had\r\n",
      "shrivelled it up: he only asked—“What have _you_ to say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An inaudible reply escaped Mason’s white lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly. I again demand,\r\n",
      "what have _you_ to say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir—sir,” interrupted the clergyman, “do not forget you are in a\r\n",
      "sacred place.” Then addressing Mason, he inquired gently, “Are you\r\n",
      "aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman’s wife is still living?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Courage,” urged the lawyer,—“speak out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is now living at Thornfield Hall,” said Mason, in more articulate\r\n",
      "tones: “I saw her there last April. I am her brother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At Thornfield Hall!” ejaculated the clergyman. “Impossible! I am an\r\n",
      "old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs.\r\n",
      "Rochester at Thornfield Hall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester’s lips, and he muttered—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it—or of her under\r\n",
      "that name.” He mused—for ten minutes he held counsel with himself: he\r\n",
      "formed his resolve, and announced it—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.\r\n",
      "Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the\r\n",
      "clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.” The man\r\n",
      "obeyed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: “Bigamy is an ugly\r\n",
      "word!—I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred\r\n",
      "me, or Providence has checked me,—perhaps the last. I am little better\r\n",
      "than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me,\r\n",
      "deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless\r\n",
      "fire and deathless worm. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:—what this\r\n",
      "lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman\r\n",
      "to whom I was married lives! You say you never heard of a Mrs.\r\n",
      "Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a\r\n",
      "time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept\r\n",
      "there under watch and ward. Some have whispered to you that she is my\r\n",
      "bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress. I now inform you that\r\n",
      "she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,—Bertha Mason by name;\r\n",
      "sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs\r\n",
      "and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear. Cheer\r\n",
      "up, Dick!—never fear me!—I’d almost as soon strike a woman as you.\r\n",
      "Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs\r\n",
      "through three generations! Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman\r\n",
      "and a drunkard!—as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they\r\n",
      "were silent on family secrets before. Bertha, like a dutiful child,\r\n",
      "copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner—pure, wise,\r\n",
      "modest: you can fancy I was a happy man. I went through rich scenes!\r\n",
      "Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you\r\n",
      "no further explanation. Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come\r\n",
      "up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole’s patient, and _my wife_! You\r\n",
      "shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge\r\n",
      "whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy\r\n",
      "with something at least human. This girl,” he continued, looking at me,\r\n",
      "“knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all\r\n",
      "was fair and legal; and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into\r\n",
      "a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad,\r\n",
      "and embruted partner! Come all of you—follow!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still holding me fast, he left the church: the three gentlemen came\r\n",
      "after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take it back to the coach-house, John,” said Mr. Rochester coolly; “it\r\n",
      "will not be wanted to-day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adèle, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet\r\n",
      "and greet us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To the right-about—every soul!” cried the master; “away with your\r\n",
      "congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!—they are fifteen years too\r\n",
      "late!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still\r\n",
      "beckoning the gentlemen to follow him, which they did. We mounted the\r\n",
      "first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey:\r\n",
      "the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester’s master-key, admitted us\r\n",
      "to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know this place, Mason,” said our guide; “she bit and stabbed you\r\n",
      "here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this,\r\n",
      "too, he opened. In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded\r\n",
      "by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a\r\n",
      "chain. Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in\r\n",
      "a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure\r\n",
      "ran backwards and forwards. What it was, whether beast or human being,\r\n",
      "one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all\r\n",
      "fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it\r\n",
      "was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild\r\n",
      "as a mane, hid its head and face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!” said Mr. Rochester. “How are you? and how is\r\n",
      "your charge to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’re tolerable, sir, I thank you,” replied Grace, lifting the boiling\r\n",
      "mess carefully on to the hob: “rather snappish, but not ’rageous.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her favourable report: the\r\n",
      "clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! sir, she sees you!” exclaimed Grace: “you’d better not stay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take care then, sir!—for God’s sake, take care!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The maniac bellowed: she parted her shaggy locks from her visage, and\r\n",
      "gazed wildly at her visitors. I recognised well that purple face,—those\r\n",
      "bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Keep out of the way,” said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her aside: “she\r\n",
      "has no knife now, I suppose, and I’m on my guard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in\r\n",
      "mortal discretion to fathom her craft.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We had better leave her,” whispered Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go to the devil!” was his brother-in-law’s recommendation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“’Ware!” cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester flung me behind him: the lunatic sprang and grappled his\r\n",
      "throat viciously, and laid her teeth to his cheek: they struggled. She\r\n",
      "was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her husband, and corpulent\r\n",
      "besides: she showed virile force in the contest—more than once she\r\n",
      "almost throttled him, athletic as he was. He could have settled her\r\n",
      "with a well-planted blow; but he would not strike: he would only\r\n",
      "wrestle. At last he mastered her arms; Grace Poole gave him a cord, and\r\n",
      "he pinioned them behind her: with more rope, which was at hand, he\r\n",
      "bound her to a chair. The operation was performed amidst the fiercest\r\n",
      "yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the\r\n",
      "spectators: he looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is _my wife_,” said he. “Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am\r\n",
      "ever to know—such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure\r\n",
      "hours! And _this_ is what I wished to have” (laying his hand on my\r\n",
      "shoulder): “this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth\r\n",
      "of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her\r\n",
      "just as a change after that fierce ragout. Wood and Briggs, look at the\r\n",
      "difference! Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder—this\r\n",
      "face with that mask—this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of\r\n",
      "the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge\r\n",
      "ye shall be judged! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some\r\n",
      "further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he\r\n",
      "descended the stair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You, madam,” said he, “are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be\r\n",
      "glad to hear it—if, indeed, he should be still living—when Mr. Mason\r\n",
      "returns to Madeira.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My uncle! What of him? Do you know him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his\r\n",
      "house for some years. When your uncle received your letter intimating\r\n",
      "the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason,\r\n",
      "who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to\r\n",
      "Jamaica, happened to be with him. Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence;\r\n",
      "for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the\r\n",
      "name of Rochester. Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may\r\n",
      "suppose, revealed the real state of matters. Your uncle, I am sorry to\r\n",
      "say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his\r\n",
      "disease—decline—and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will\r\n",
      "ever rise. He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate\r\n",
      "you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason\r\n",
      "to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage. He\r\n",
      "referred him to me for assistance. I used all despatch, and am thankful\r\n",
      "I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally\r\n",
      "certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would\r\n",
      "advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had\r\n",
      "better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of\r\n",
      "Mr. Eyre. Have we anything else to stay for?” he inquired of Mr. Mason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no—let us be gone,” was the anxious reply; and without waiting to\r\n",
      "take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door. The\r\n",
      "clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or\r\n",
      "reproof, with his haughty parishioner; this duty done, he too departed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I heard him go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to\r\n",
      "which I had now withdrawn. The house cleared, I shut myself in,\r\n",
      "fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded—not to weep,\r\n",
      "not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but—mechanically to take off\r\n",
      "the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff gown I had worn\r\n",
      "yesterday, as I thought, for the last time. I then sat down: I felt\r\n",
      "weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on\r\n",
      "them. And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen,\r\n",
      "moved—followed up and down where I was led or dragged—watched event\r\n",
      "rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but _now_, _I\r\n",
      "thought_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The morning had been a quiet morning enough—all except the brief scene\r\n",
      "with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy;\r\n",
      "there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no\r\n",
      "defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken,\r\n",
      "a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short\r\n",
      "questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence\r\n",
      "adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master;\r\n",
      "then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all\r\n",
      "was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was in my own room as usual—just myself, without obvious change:\r\n",
      "nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me. And yet where was\r\n",
      "the Jane Eyre of yesterday?—where was her life?—where were her\r\n",
      "prospects?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman—almost a bride, was\r\n",
      "a cold, solitary girl again: her life was pale; her prospects were\r\n",
      "desolate. A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December\r\n",
      "storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed\r\n",
      "the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes\r\n",
      "which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with\r\n",
      "untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and\r\n",
      "fragrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and\r\n",
      "white as pine-forests in wintry Norway. My hopes were all dead—struck\r\n",
      "with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born\r\n",
      "in the land of Egypt. I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so\r\n",
      "blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could\r\n",
      "never revive. I looked at my love: that feeling which was my\r\n",
      "master’s—which he had created; it shivered in my heart, like a\r\n",
      "suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it;\r\n",
      "it could not seek Mr. Rochester’s arms—it could not derive warmth from\r\n",
      "his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was\r\n",
      "blighted—confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had\r\n",
      "been; for he was not what I had thought him. I would not ascribe vice\r\n",
      "to him; I would not say he had betrayed me; but the attribute of\r\n",
      "stainless truth was gone from his idea, and from his presence I must\r\n",
      "go: _that_ I perceived well. When—how—whither, I could not yet discern;\r\n",
      "but he himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield. Real\r\n",
      "affection, it seemed, he could not have for me; it had been only fitful\r\n",
      "passion: that was balked; he would want me no more. I should fear even\r\n",
      "to cross his path now: my view must be hateful to him. Oh, how blind\r\n",
      "had been my eyes! How weak my conduct!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round\r\n",
      "me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.\r\n",
      "Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down\r\n",
      "in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in\r\n",
      "remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise I had no will, to\r\n",
      "flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead. One idea only\r\n",
      "still throbbed life-like within me—a remembrance of God: it begot an\r\n",
      "unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless\r\n",
      "mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to\r\n",
      "express them—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it—as I\r\n",
      "had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips—it\r\n",
      "came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole\r\n",
      "consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith\r\n",
      "death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That\r\n",
      "bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, “the waters came into my\r\n",
      "soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters;\r\n",
      "the floods overflowed me.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and\r\n",
      "seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I\r\n",
      "asked, “What am I to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the answer my mind gave—“Leave Thornfield at once”—was so prompt,\r\n",
      "so dread, that I stopped my ears. I said I could not bear such words\r\n",
      "now. “That I am not Edward Rochester’s bride is the least part of my\r\n",
      "woe,” I alleged: “that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and\r\n",
      "found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but\r\n",
      "that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable. I\r\n",
      "cannot do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold\r\n",
      "that I should do it. I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be\r\n",
      "weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw\r\n",
      "laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the\r\n",
      "throat, told her tauntingly, she had yet but dipped her dainty foot in\r\n",
      "the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he would thrust her\r\n",
      "down to unsounded depths of agony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me be torn away, then” I cried. “Let another help me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall\r\n",
      "yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand:\r\n",
      "your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a\r\n",
      "judge haunted,—at the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head\r\n",
      "swam as I stood erect. I perceived that I was sickening from excitement\r\n",
      "and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for\r\n",
      "I had taken no breakfast. And, with a strange pang, I now reflected\r\n",
      "that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask\r\n",
      "how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adèle had\r\n",
      "tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me. “Friends\r\n",
      "always forget those whom fortune forsakes,” I murmured, as I undrew the\r\n",
      "bolt and passed out. I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still\r\n",
      "dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon\r\n",
      "recover myself. I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm\r\n",
      "caught me. I looked up—I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a\r\n",
      "chair across my chamber threshold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You come out at last,” he said. “Well, I have been waiting for you\r\n",
      "long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob:\r\n",
      "five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the\r\n",
      "lock like a burglar. So you shun me?—you shut yourself up and grieve\r\n",
      "alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence. You\r\n",
      "are passionate: I expected a scene of some kind. I was prepared for the\r\n",
      "hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a\r\n",
      "senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief. But I\r\n",
      "err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but\r\n",

      "his look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond\r\n",
      "and plunge headlong into wild license. I saw that in another moment,\r\n",

      "would have sealed my doom,—and his. But I was not afraid: not in the\r\n",
      "least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported\r\n",
      "me. The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the\r\n",
      "Indian, perhaps, feels when he slips over the rapid in his canoe. I\r\n",
      "took hold of his clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and\r\n",
      "said to him, soothingly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit down; I’ll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have\r\n",
      "to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.”\r\n",

      "considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they\r\n",
      "liked. If the flood annoyed him, so much the better. So I gave way and\r\n",
      "cried heartily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon I heard him earnestly entreating me to be composed. I said I could\r\n",

      "“Jane! Jane!” he said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "These words cut me: yet what could I do or I say? I ought probably to\r\n",

      "where I had wounded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“The last time, Jane! What! do you think you can live with me, and see\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Of course: I told you you should. I pass over the madness about\r\n",

      "in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the\r\n",
      "Mediterranean. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most\r\n",
      "innocent life. Never fear that I wish to lure you into error—to make\r\n",

      "To agitate him thus deeply, by a resistance he so abhorred, was cruel:\r\n",
      "to yield was out of the question. I did what human beings do\r\n",
      "instinctively when they are driven to utter extremity—looked for aid to\r\n",

      "me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.\r\n",
      "Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man. I\r\n",
      "must be provided for by a wealthy marriage. He sought me a partner\r\n",

      "thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed. When I left college, I was sent\r\n",
      "out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. My father\r\n",
      "said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast\r\n",
      "of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie. I found her a fine\r\n",
      "woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic. Her\r\n",
      "family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did\r\n",
      "she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed. I seldom saw\r\n",
      "her alone, and had very little private conversation with her. She\r\n",
      "flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and\r\n",
      "accomplishments. All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and\r\n",
      "envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being\r\n",

      "that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of\r\n",
      "you or watched for you. The next day I observed you—myself unseen—for\r\n",
      "half-an-hour, while you played with Adèle in the gallery. It was a\r\n",
      "snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors. I was in my\r\n",
      "room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. Adèle claimed\r\n",
      "your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were\r\n",
      "elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you\r\n",
      "talked to her and amused her a long time. When at last she left you,\r\n",
      "you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to\r\n",
      "pace the gallery. Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out\r\n",
      "at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again\r\n",
      "you paced gently on and dreamed. I think those day visions were not\r\n",
      "dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a\r\n",
      "soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious,\r\n",
      "hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of\r\n",
      "youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up\r\n",
      "and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a\r\n",
      "servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and\r\n",
      "at yourself, Janet! There was much sense in your smile: it was very\r\n",
      "shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction. It seemed to\r\n",
      "say—‘My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are\r\n",
      "absolutely unreal. I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my\r\n",
      "brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract\r\n",
      "to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.’ You ran\r\n",
      "downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly\r\n",
      "house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was. I\r\n",
      "was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my\r\n",
      "presence. An unusual—to me—a perfectly new character I suspected was\r\n",
      "yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better. You entered\r\n",
      "the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were\r\n",
      "quaintly dressed—much as you are now. I made you talk: ere long I found\r\n",
      "you full of strange contrasts. Your garb and manner were restricted by\r\n",
      "rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined\r\n",
      "by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of\r\n",
      "making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or\r\n",
      "blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing\r\n",
      "eye to your interlocutor’s face: there was penetration and power in\r\n",
      "each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready\r\n",
      "and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe\r\n",
      "you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross\r\n",
      "master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain\r\n",
      "pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed\r\n",
      "no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you\r\n",
      "watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious\r\n",
      "grace I cannot describe. I was at once content and stimulated with what\r\n",
      "I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more. Yet, for a long\r\n",
      "time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely. I was an\r\n",
      "intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making\r\n",
      "this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while\r\n",
      "troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its\r\n",
      "bloom would fade—the sweet charm of freshness would leave it. I did not\r\n",
      "then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant\r\n",
      "resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem. Moreover, I wished to\r\n",
      "see whether you would seek me if I shunned you—but you did not; you\r\n",
      "kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by\r\n",
      "chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of\r\n",
      "recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression\r\n",
      "in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you\r\n",
      "were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no\r\n",
      "actual pleasure. I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever\r\n",
      "thought of me, and resolved to find this out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I resumed my notice of you. There was something glad in your glance,\r\n",
      "and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social\r\n",
      "heart; it was the silent schoolroom—it was the tedium of your life—that\r\n",
      "made you mournful. I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you;\r\n",
      "kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression,\r\n",
      "your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a\r\n",
      "grateful happy accent. I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane,\r\n",
      "at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you\r\n",
      "glanced at me with a slight trouble—a hovering doubt: you did not know\r\n",
      "what my caprice might be—whether I was going to play the master and be\r\n",
      "stern, or the friend and be benignant. I was now too fond of you often\r\n",
      "to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out\r\n",
      "cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful\r\n",
      "features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t talk any more of those days, sir,” I interrupted, furtively\r\n",
      "dashing away some tears from my eyes; his language was torture to me;\r\n",
      "for I knew what I must do—and do soon—and all these reminiscences, and\r\n",
      "these revelations of his feelings only made my work more difficult.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Jane,” he returned: “what necessity is there to dwell on the Past,\r\n",
      "when the Present is so much surer—the Future so much brighter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion.\r\n",

      "solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love—I have\r\n",
      "found _you_. You are my sympathy—my better self—my good angel. I am\r\n",
      "bound to you with a strong attachment. I think you good, gifted,\r\n",
      "lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans\r\n",
      "to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence\r\n",
      "about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in\r\n",
      "one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you. To\r\n",
      "tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I\r\n",
      "had but a hideous demon. I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I\r\n",
      "feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early\r\n",
      "instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding\r\n",
      "confidences. This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your\r\n",
      "nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now—opened to you plainly\r\n",
      "my life of agony—described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher\r\n",
      "and worthier existence—shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is\r\n",
      "weak), but my resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am\r\n",
      "faithfully and well loved in return. Then I should have asked you to\r\n",

      "Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! Not a human\r\n",
      "being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved;\r\n",
      "and him who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce\r\n",

      "grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror—for this still\r\n",
      "voice was the pant of a lion rising—“Jane, do you mean to go one way in\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the\r\n",
      "certainty of ultimate safety. The soul, fortunately, has an\r\n",
      "interpreter—often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter—in\r\n",
      "the eye. My eye rose to his; and while I looked in his fierce face I\r\n",

      "crushed her? Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing\r\n",
      "looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage—with a stern\r\n",
      "triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it—the savage,\r\n",
      "beautiful creature! If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage\r\n",
      "will only let the captive loose. Conqueror I might be of the house; but\r\n",

      "deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I would have got past Mr. Rochester’s chamber without a pause; but my\r\n",
      "heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was\r\n",
      "forced to stop also. No sleep was there: the inmate was walking\r\n",
      "restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he sighed while I\r\n",
      "listened. There was a heaven—a temporary heaven—in this room for me, if\r\n",
      "I chose: I had but to go in and to say—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till\r\n",
      "death,” and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips. I thought of\r\n",
      "this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience\r\n",
      "for day. He would send for me in the morning; I should be gone. He\r\n",
      "would have me sought for: vainly. He would feel himself forsaken; his\r\n",
      "love rejected: he would suffer; perhaps grow desperate. I thought of\r\n",
      "this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided\r\n",
      "on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did\r\n",
      "it mechanically. I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I\r\n",
      "sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the\r\n",
      "lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to\r\n",
      "walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.\r\n",
      "All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut\r\n",
      "it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed\r\n",
      "and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that\r\n",
      "I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the\r\n",
      "contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often\r\n",
      "noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps. No\r\n",
      "reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back;\r\n",
      "not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the\r\n",
      "past or the future. The first was a page so heavenly sweet—so deadly\r\n",
      "sad—that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break\r\n",
      "down my energy. The last was an awful blank: something like the world\r\n",
      "when the deluge was gone by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise. I believe\r\n",
      "it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on\r\n",
      "when I left the house, were soon wet with dew. But I looked neither to\r\n",
      "rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. He who is taken out\r\n",
      "to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers\r\n",
      "that smile on his road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the\r\n",
      "disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I\r\n",
      "thought of drear flight and homeless wandering—and oh! with agony I\r\n",
      "thought of what I left. I could not help it. I thought of him now—in\r\n",
      "his room—watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would\r\n",
      "stay with him and be his. I longed to be his; I panted to return: it\r\n",
      "was not too late; I could yet spare him the bitter pang of bereavement.\r\n",
      "As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be\r\n",
      "his comforter—his pride; his redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.\r\n",
      "Oh, that fear of his self-abandonment—far worse than my abandonment—how\r\n",
      "it goaded me! It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when\r\n",
      "I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it\r\n",
      "farther in. Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful\r\n",
      "to their mates; birds were emblems of love. What was I? In the midst of\r\n",
      "my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I\r\n",
      "had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect. I had\r\n",
      "injured—wounded—left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I\r\n",
      "could not turn, nor retrace one step. God must have led me on. As to my\r\n",
      "own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled\r\n",
      "the other. I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way:\r\n",
      "fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly,\r\n",
      "extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell: I lay on the ground some\r\n",
      "minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I had some fear—or hope—that\r\n",
      "here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and\r\n",
      "knees, and then again raised to my feet—as eager and as determined as\r\n",
      "ever to reach the road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and\r\n",
      "while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on. I stood up and\r\n",
      "lifted my hand; it stopped. I asked where it was going: the driver\r\n",
      "named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no\r\n",
      "connections. I asked for what sum he would take me there; he said\r\n",
      "thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he would try to\r\n",
      "make it do. He further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the\r\n",
      "vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never\r\n",
      "shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May\r\n",
      "you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in\r\n",
      "that hour left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the\r\n",
      "instrument of evil to what you wholly love.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two days are passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me\r\n",
      "down at a place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the\r\n",
      "sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the\r\n",
      "world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment\r\n",
      "I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the\r\n",
      "coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it\r\n",
      "must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set\r\n",
      "up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at\r\n",
      "a distance and in darkness. Four arms spring from its summit: the\r\n",
      "nearest town to which these point is, according to the inscription,\r\n",
      "distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. From the well-known\r\n",
      "names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a\r\n",
      "north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I\r\n",
      "see. There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are\r\n",
      "waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet. The\r\n",
      "population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads:\r\n",
      "they stretch out east, west, north, and south—white, broad, lonely;\r\n",
      "they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to\r\n",
      "their very verge. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no\r\n",
      "eye to see me now: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering\r\n",
      "here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be\r\n",
      "questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and\r\n",
      "excite suspicion. Not a tie holds me to human society at this\r\n",
      "moment—not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are—none\r\n",
      "that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me. I have no\r\n",
      "relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her breast and\r\n",
      "ask repose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply\r\n",
      "furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I\r\n",
      "turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in\r\n",
      "a hidden angle, I sat down under it. High banks of moor were about me;\r\n",
      "the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread\r\n",
      "that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might\r\n",
      "discover me. If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it\r\n",
      "was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.\r\n",
      "Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep\r\n",
      "silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took\r\n",
      "confidence. As yet I had not thought; I had only listened, watched,\r\n",
      "dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What was I to do? Where to go? Oh, intolerable questions, when I could\r\n",
      "do nothing and go nowhere!—when a long way must yet be measured by my\r\n",
      "weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation—when cold\r\n",
      "charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant\r\n",
      "sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale\r\n",
      "could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the\r\n",
      "summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled\r\n",
      "just above the chasm ridge. The dew fell, but with propitious softness;\r\n",
      "no breeze whispered. Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she\r\n",
      "loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only\r\n",
      "mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her with filial fondness.\r\n",
      "To-night, at least, I would be her guest, as I was her child: my mother\r\n",
      "would lodge me without money and without price. I had one morsel of\r\n",
      "bread yet: the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed\r\n",
      "through at noon with a stray penny—my last coin. I saw ripe bilberries\r\n",
      "gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a\r\n",
      "handful and ate them with the bread. My hunger, sharp before, was, if\r\n",
      "not satisfied, appeased by this hermit’s meal. I said my evening\r\n",
      "prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I said my evening prayers\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were\r\n",
      "buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for\r\n",
      "the night-air to invade. I folded my shawl double, and spread it over\r\n",
      "me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow. Thus lodged, I was\r\n",
      "not, at least at the commencement of the night, cold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it. It\r\n",
      "plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. It\r\n",
      "trembled for Mr. Rochester and his doom; it bemoaned him with bitter\r\n",
      "pity; it demanded him with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird\r\n",
      "with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain\r\n",
      "attempts to seek him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees. Night was\r\n",
      "come, and her planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for\r\n",
      "the companionship of fear. We know that God is everywhere; but\r\n",
      "certainly we feel His presence most when His works are on the grandest\r\n",
      "scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His\r\n",
      "worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His infinitude,\r\n",
      "His omnipotence, His omnipresence. I had risen to my knees to pray for\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester. Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty\r\n",
      "Milky-way. Remembering what it was—what countless systems there swept\r\n",
      "space like a soft trace of light—I felt the might and strength of God.\r\n",
      "Sure was I of His efficiency to save what He had made: convinced I grew\r\n",
      "that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured. I\r\n",
      "turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the\r\n",
      "Saviour of spirits. Mr. Rochester was safe: he was God’s, and by God\r\n",
      "would he be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere\r\n",
      "long in sleep forgot sorrow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. Long after the little\r\n",
      "birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime\r\n",
      "of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried—when the long\r\n",
      "morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky—I got\r\n",
      "up, and I looked round me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What a still, hot, perfect day! What a golden desert this spreading\r\n",
      "moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw\r\n",
      "a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet\r\n",
      "bilberries. I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that\r\n",
      "I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here. But I was\r\n",
      "a human being, and had a human being’s wants: I must not linger where\r\n",
      "there was nothing to supply them. I rose; I looked back at the bed I\r\n",
      "had left. Hopeless of the future, I wished but this—that my Maker had\r\n",
      "that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and\r\n",
      "that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with\r\n",
      "fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil\r\n",
      "of this wilderness. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all\r\n",
      "its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities. The burden must be\r\n",
      "carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the\r\n",
      "responsibility fulfilled. I set out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now\r\n",
      "fervent and high. By no other circumstance had I will to decide my\r\n",
      "choice. I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done\r\n",
      "enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost\r\n",
      "overpowered me—might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a\r\n",
      "stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart\r\n",
      "and limb—I heard a bell chime—a church bell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic\r\n",
      "hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw\r\n",
      "a hamlet and a spire. All the valley at my right hand was full of\r\n",
      "pasture-fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran\r\n",
      "zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the\r\n",
      "sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea. Recalled by the rumbling of\r\n",
      "wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up\r\n",
      "the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover. Human life\r\n",
      "and human labour were near. I must struggle on: strive to live and bend\r\n",
      "to toil like the rest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About two o’clock P.M. I entered the village. At the bottom of its one\r\n",
      "street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window.\r\n",
      "I coveted a cake of bread. With that refreshment I could perhaps regain\r\n",
      "a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The\r\n",
      "wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I\r\n",
      "was amongst my fellow-beings. I felt it would be degrading to faint\r\n",
      "with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could\r\n",
      "offer in exchange for one of these rolls? I considered. I had a small\r\n",
      "silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly\r\n",
      "tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded. I did\r\n",
      "not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably\r\n",
      "they would not; but I must try.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I entered the shop: a woman was there. Seeing a respectably-dressed\r\n",
      "person, a lady as she supposed, she came forward with civility. How\r\n",
      "could she serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter\r\n",
      "the request I had prepared. I dared not offer her the half-worn gloves,\r\n",
      "the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only\r\n",
      "begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired. Disappointed in\r\n",
      "the expectation of a customer, she coolly acceded to my request. She\r\n",
      "pointed to a seat; I sank into it. I felt sorely urged to weep; but\r\n",
      "conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained\r\n",
      "it. Soon I asked her “if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman\r\n",
      "in the village?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I reflected. I was driven to the point now. I was brought face to face\r\n",
      "with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource,\r\n",
      "without a friend, without a coin. I must do something. What? I must\r\n",
      "apply somewhere. Where?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was\r\n",
      "wanted?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nay; she couldn’t say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people\r\n",
      "do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver’s\r\n",
      "needle-factory, and at the foundry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Mr. Oliver employ women?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nay; it was men’s work.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what do the women do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knawn’t,” was the answer. “Some does one thing, and some another.\r\n",
      "Poor folk mun get on as they can.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I\r\n",
      "to importune her? A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently\r\n",
      "wanted. I took leave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the\r\n",
      "right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an\r\n",
      "inducement to enter any. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to\r\n",
      "a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more. Much\r\n",
      "exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside\r\n",
      "into a lane and sat down under the hedge. Ere many minutes had elapsed,\r\n",
      "I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something—a\r\n",
      "resource, or at least an informant. A pretty little house stood at the\r\n",
      "top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and\r\n",
      "brilliantly blooming. I stopped at it. What business had I to approach\r\n",
      "the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it\r\n",
      "possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve\r\n",
      "me? Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young\r\n",
      "woman opened the door. In such a voice as might be expected from a\r\n",
      "hopeless heart and fainting frame—a voice wretchedly low and\r\n",
      "faltering—I asked if a servant was wanted here?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said she; “we do not keep a servant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?” I\r\n",
      "continued. “I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place. I want\r\n",
      "some work: no matter what.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it was not her business to think for me, or to seek a place for me:\r\n",
      "besides, in her eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character,\r\n",
      "position, tale. She shook her head, she “was sorry she could give me no\r\n",
      "information,” and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but\r\n",
      "it shut me out. If she had held it open a little longer, I believe I\r\n",
      "should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no\r\n",
      "prospect of aid was visible. I should have longed rather to deviate to\r\n",
      "a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer\r\n",
      "inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature’s\r\n",
      "cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a\r\n",
      "chance of food. Solitude would be no solitude—rest no rest—while the\r\n",
      "vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I\r\n",
      "wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim\r\n",
      "to ask—no right to expect interest in my isolated lot. Meantime, the\r\n",
      "afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and\r\n",
      "starving dog. In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I\r\n",
      "hastened towards it. Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a\r\n",
      "garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was\r\n",
      "the parsonage. I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where\r\n",
      "they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the\r\n",
      "clergyman for introduction and aid. It is the clergyman’s function to\r\n",
      "help—at least with advice—those who wished to help themselves. I seemed\r\n",
      "to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my\r\n",
      "courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on. I\r\n",
      "reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman\r\n",
      "opened: I asked was this the parsonage?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was the clergyman in?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "stay there a fortnight longer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was there any lady of the house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was\r\n",
      "sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more I took off my handkerchief—once more I thought of the cakes\r\n",
      "of bread in the little shop. Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful\r\n",
      "to allay the pang of famine! Instinctively I turned my face again to\r\n",
      "the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others\r\n",
      "were there besides the woman I ventured the request—“Would she give me\r\n",
      "a roll for this handkerchief?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "that way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she again refused. “How\r\n",

      "Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details. Some say there is\r\n",
      "enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I\r\n",
      "can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral\r\n",
      "degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a\r\n",
      "recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on. I blamed none of those who\r\n",
      "repulsed me. I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not\r\n",
      "be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a\r\n",
      "well-dressed beggar inevitably so. To be sure, what I begged was\r\n",
      "employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?\r\n",
      "Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and\r\n",
      "who knew nothing about my character. And as to the woman who would not\r\n",
      "take my handkerchief in exchange for her bread, why, she was right, if\r\n",
      "the offer appeared to her sinister or the exchange unprofitable. Let me\r\n",
      "condense now. I am sick of the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which\r\n",
      "the farmer was sitting, eating his supper of bread and cheese. I\r\n",
      "stopped and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.” He cast on\r\n",
      "me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he cut a thick slice\r\n",
      "from his loaf, and gave it to me. I imagine he did not think I was a\r\n",
      "beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to\r\n",
      "his brown loaf. As soon as I was out of sight of his house, I sat down\r\n",
      "and ate it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the\r\n",
      "wood I have before alluded to. But my night was wretched, my rest\r\n",
      "broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed\r\n",
      "near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my\r\n",
      "quarters: no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me. Towards\r\n",
      "morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet. Do not ask\r\n",
      "me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought\r\n",
      "work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did\r\n",
      "food pass my lips. At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about\r\n",
      "to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough. “Will you give me\r\n",
      "that?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you give me that?” I asked\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stared at me. “Mother!” she exclaimed, “there is a woman wants me\r\n",
      "to give her these porridge.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well lass,” replied a voice within, “give it her if she’s a beggar. T’\r\n",
      "pig doesn’t want it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it\r\n",
      "ravenously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path,\r\n",
      "which I had been pursuing an hour or more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My strength is quite failing me,” I said in a soliloquy. “I feel I\r\n",
      "cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night? While\r\n",
      "the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?\r\n",
      "I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me? But it will be\r\n",
      "very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this\r\n",
      "sense of desolation—this total prostration of hope. In all likelihood,\r\n",
      "though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself\r\n",
      "to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?\r\n",
      "Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die\r\n",
      "of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively. Oh,\r\n",
      "Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!—direct me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had\r\n",
      "strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight. The very\r\n",
      "cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. I had, by cross-ways and\r\n",
      "by-paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a\r\n",
      "few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which\r\n",
      "they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented\r\n",
      "road,” I reflected. “And far better that crows and ravens—if any ravens\r\n",
      "there be in these regions—should pick my flesh from my bones, than that\r\n",
      "they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper’s\r\n",
      "grave.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. It remained now only to find\r\n",
      "a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not\r\n",
      "secure. But all the surface of the waste looked level. It showed no\r\n",
      "variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes;\r\n",
      "black, where the dry soil bore only heath. Dark as it was getting, I\r\n",
      "could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light\r\n",
      "and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge,\r\n",
      "vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in\r\n",
      "among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up. “That is an _ignis\r\n",
      "fatuus_,” was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It\r\n",
      "burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing. “Is\r\n",
      "it, then, a bonfire just kindled?” I questioned. I watched to see\r\n",
      "whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not\r\n",
      "enlarge. “It may be a candle in a house,” I then conjectured; “but if\r\n",
      "so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a\r\n",
      "yard of me, what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have\r\n",
      "it shut in my face.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground. I\r\n",
      "lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and\r\n",
      "died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to\r\n",
      "the skin. Could I but have stiffened to the still frost—the friendly\r\n",
      "numbness of death—it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it;\r\n",
      "but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence. I rose ere\r\n",
      "long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I\r\n",
      "tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it. It\r\n",
      "led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been\r\n",
      "impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the\r\n",
      "height of summer. Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my\r\n",
      "faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. I\r\n",
      "approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the\r\n",
      "light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of\r\n",
      "trees—firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character\r\n",
      "of their forms and foliage through the gloom. My star vanished as I\r\n",
      "drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it. I put out my\r\n",
      "hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones\r\n",
      "of a low wall—above it, something like palisades, and within, a high\r\n",
      "and prickly hedge. I groped on. Again a whitish object gleamed before\r\n",
      "me: it was a gate—a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it. On\r\n",
      "each side stood a sable bush—holly or yew.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house\r\n",
      "rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone\r\n",
      "nowhere. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest? I feared\r\n",
      "it must be so. In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out\r\n",
      "the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small\r\n",
      "latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the\r\n",
      "growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered\r\n",
      "thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set. The\r\n",
      "aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been\r\n",
      "deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of\r\n",
      "foliage shooting over it, I could see all within. I could see clearly a\r\n",
      "room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with\r\n",
      "pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a\r\n",
      "glowing peat-fire. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some\r\n",
      "chairs. The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table;\r\n",
      "and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but\r\n",
      "scrupulously clean, like all about her, was knitting a stocking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I noticed these objects cursorily only—in them there was nothing\r\n",
      "extraordinary. A group of more interest appeared near the hearth,\r\n",
      "sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. Two young,\r\n",
      "graceful women—ladies in every point—sat, one in a low rocking-chair,\r\n",
      "the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and\r\n",
      "bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and\r\n",
      "faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of\r\n",
      "one girl—in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants! Who were\r\n",
      "they? They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the\r\n",
      "table; for she looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and\r\n",
      "cultivation. I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I\r\n",
      "gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament. I cannot call\r\n",
      "them handsome—they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each\r\n",
      "bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity. A stand\r\n",
      "between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which\r\n",
      "they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller\r\n",
      "books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to\r\n",
      "aid them in the task of translation. This scene was as silent as if all\r\n",
      "the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so\r\n",
      "hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate, the clock\r\n",
      "tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the\r\n",
      "click-click of the woman’s knitting-needles. When, therefore, a voice\r\n",
      "broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, Diana,” said one of the absorbed students; “Franz and old\r\n",
      "Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream\r\n",
      "from which he has awakened in terror—listen!” And in a low voice she\r\n",
      "read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it\r\n",
      "was in an unknown tongue—neither French nor Latin. Whether it were\r\n",
      "Greek or German I could not tell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is strong,” she said, when she had finished: “I relish it.” The\r\n",
      "other girl, who had lifted her head to listen to her sister, repeated,\r\n",
      "while she gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read. At a later\r\n",
      "day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the\r\n",
      "line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on\r\n",
      "sounding brass to me—conveying no meaning:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“‘Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.’ Good! good!”\r\n",
      "she exclaimed, while her dark and deep eye sparkled. “There you have a\r\n",
      "dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you! The line is worth a\r\n",
      "hundred pages of fustian. ‘Ich wäge die Gedanken in der Schale meines\r\n",
      "Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.’ I like it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were again silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there ony country where they talk i’ that way?” asked the old\r\n",
      "woman, looking up from her knitting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Hannah—a far larger country than England, where they talk in no\r\n",
      "other way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, for sure case, I knawn’t how they can understand t’ one t’other:\r\n",
      "and if either o’ ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all—for we\r\n",
      "are not as clever as you think us, Hannah. We don’t speak German, and\r\n",
      "we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what good does it do you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Mortally: after all, it’s tough work fagging away at a language with\r\n",
      "no master but a lexicon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little\r\n",
      "gold watch she drew from her girdle). It rains fast, Hannah: will you\r\n",
      "have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman rose: she opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage:\r\n",
      "soon I heard her stir a fire in an inner room; she presently came back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, childer!” said she, “it fair troubles me to go into yond’ room\r\n",
      "now: it looks so lonesome wi’ the chair empty and set back in a\r\n",
      "corner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o’ ye to be sent for,\r\n",

      "about to withdraw to the parlour. Till this moment, I had been so\r\n",
      "intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited\r\n",
      "in me so keen an interest, I had half-forgotten my own wretched\r\n",
      "position: now it recurred to me. More desolate, more desperate than\r\n",
      "ever, it seemed from contrast. And how impossible did it appear to\r\n",
      "touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them\r\n",
      "believe in the truth of my wants and woes—to induce them to vouchsafe a\r\n",
      "rest for my wanderings! As I groped out the door, and knocked at it\r\n",
      "hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera. Hannah\r\n",
      "opened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What is your business here at this hour?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "bread to eat.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah’s face. “I’ll\r\n",
      "give you a piece of bread,” she said, after a pause; “but we can’t take\r\n",
      "in a vagrant to lodge. It isn’t likely.”\r\n",

      "“Do let me speak to your mistresses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "now; it looks very ill.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But where shall I go if you drive me away? What shall I do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I’ll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don’t\r\n",
      "do wrong, that’s all. Here is a penny; now go—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don’t\r\n",
      "shut the door:—oh, don’t, for God’s sake!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must; the rain is driving in—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell the young ladies. Let me see them—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn’t\r\n",
      "make such a noise. Move off.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I must die if I am turned away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "followers—housebreakers or such like—anywhere near, you may tell them\r\n",
      "we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs,\r\n",

      "This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering—a throe of true\r\n",

      "hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation—this banishment\r\n",
      "from my kind! Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude\r\n",

      "These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my\r\n",

      "there—dumb and still.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All men must die,” said a voice quite close at hand; “but all are not\r\n",

      "be if you perished here of want.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who or what speaks?” I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and\r\n",
      "incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid. A form was\r\n",
      "near—what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented\r\n",
      "me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed\r\n",

      "in—your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad\r\n",
      "folks about. There has been a beggar-woman—I declare she is not gone\r\n",
      "yet!—laid down there. Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your\r\n",
      "duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her. I was near, and\r\n",
      "listened to both you and her. I think this is a peculiar case—I must at\r\n",
      "least examine into it. Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the\r\n",
      "house.”\r\n",

      "With difficulty I obeyed him. Presently I stood within that clean,\r\n",
      "bright kitchen—on the very hearth—trembling, sickening; conscious of an\r\n",
      "aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten. The two\r\n",
      "ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing\r\n",
      "at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“St. John, who is it?” I heard one ask.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She does look white,” said Hannah.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As white as clay or death,” was responded. “She will fall: let her\r\n",
      "sit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me. I still\r\n",
      "possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps a little water would restore her. Hannah, fetch some. But she\r\n",
      "is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A mere spectre!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is she ill, or only famished?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of\r\n",
      "bread.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Diana (I knew her by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and\r\n",
      "the fire as she bent over me) broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and\r\n",
      "put it to my lips. Her face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it,\r\n",
      "and I felt sympathy in her hurried breathing. In her simple words, too,\r\n",
      "the same balm-like emotion spoke: “Try to eat.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes—try,” repeated Mary gently; and Mary’s hand removed my sodden\r\n",
      "bonnet and lifted my head. I tasted what they offered me: feebly at\r\n",
      "first, eagerly soon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not too much at first—restrain her,” said the brother; “she has had\r\n",
      "enough.” And he withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little more, St. John—look at the avidity in her eyes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No more at present, sister. Try if she can speak now—ask her her\r\n",
      "name.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt I could speak, and I answered—“My name is Jane Elliott.” Anxious\r\n",
      "as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an _alias_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And where do you live? Where are your friends?”\r\n",

      "“What account can you give of yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and\r\n",
      "once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer\r\n",
      "outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world. I dared to put off\r\n",
      "the mendicant—to resume my natural manner and character. I began once\r\n",
      "more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account—which at\r\n",
      "present I was far too weak to render—I said after a brief pause—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sir, I can give you no details to-night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what, then,” said he, “do you expect me to do for you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing,” I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers. Diana\r\n",
      "took the word—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean,” she asked, “that we have now given you what aid you\r\n",
      "require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked at her. She had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct\r\n",
      "both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage. Answering her\r\n",
      "compassionate gaze with a smile, I said—“I will trust you. If I were a\r\n",
      "masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your\r\n",
      "hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear. Do with me and for me\r\n",
      "as you like; but excuse me from much discourse—my breath is short—I\r\n",
      "feel a spasm when I speak.” All three surveyed me, and all three were\r\n",
      "silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hannah,” said Mr. St. John, at last, “let her sit there at present,\r\n",
      "and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder\r\n",
      "of that milk and bread. Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and\r\n",
      "talk the matter over.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned—I could not tell\r\n",
      "which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the\r\n",
      "genial fire. In an undertone she gave some directions to Hannah. Ere\r\n",
      "long, with the servant’s aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my\r\n",
      "dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me. I\r\n",
      "thanked God—experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of\r\n",
      "grateful joy—and slept.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very\r\n",
      "dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but\r\n",
      "few thoughts framed, and no actions performed. I knew I was in a small\r\n",
      "room and in a narrow bed. To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on\r\n",
      "it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been\r\n",
      "almost to kill me. I took no note of the lapse of time—of the change\r\n",
      "from morning to noon, from noon to evening. I observed when any one\r\n",
      "entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could\r\n",
      "understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could\r\n",
      "not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.\r\n",
      "Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her coming disturbed\r\n",
      "me. I had a feeling that she wished me away: that she did not\r\n",
      "understand me or my circumstances; that she was prejudiced against me.\r\n",
      "Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day. They would\r\n",
      "whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very well we took her in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the\r\n",
      "morning had she been left out all night. I wonder what she has gone\r\n",
      "through?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Strange hardships, I imagine—poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of\r\n",
      "speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off,\r\n",
      "though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like\r\n",
      "it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy\r\n",
      "would be agreeable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the\r\n",
      "hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion\r\n",
      "to, myself. I was comforted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. St. John came but once: he looked at me, and said my state of\r\n",
      "lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted\r\n",
      "fatigue. He pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he was\r\n",
      "sure, would manage best, left to herself. He said every nerve had been\r\n",
      "overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a\r\n",
      "while. There was no disease. He imagined my recovery would be rapid\r\n",
      "enough when once commenced. These opinions he delivered in a few words,\r\n",
      "in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man\r\n",
      "little accustomed to expansive comment, “Rather an unusual physiognomy;\r\n",
      "certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Far otherwise,” responded Diana. “To speak truth, St. John, my heart\r\n",
      "rather warms to the poor little soul. I wish we may be able to benefit\r\n",
      "her permanently.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is hardly likely,” was the reply. “You will find she is some\r\n",
      "young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has\r\n",
      "probably injudiciously left them. We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring\r\n",
      "her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her\r\n",
      "face which make me sceptical of her tractability.” He stood considering\r\n",
      "me some minutes; then added, “She looks sensible, but not at all\r\n",
      "handsome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is so ill, St. John.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ill or well, she would always be plain. The grace and harmony of\r\n",
      "beauty are quite wanting in those features.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise\r\n",
      "in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast,\r\n",
      "about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour. I had eaten with relish: the\r\n",
      "food was good—void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned\r\n",
      "what I had swallowed. When she left me, I felt comparatively strong and\r\n",
      "revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me. I\r\n",
      "wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired\r\n",
      "apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh. I\r\n",
      "felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the\r\n",
      "humiliation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry. My\r\n",
      "black silk frock hung against the wall. The traces of the bog were\r\n",
      "removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite\r\n",
      "decent. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered\r\n",
      "presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb\r\n",
      "and brush to smooth my hair. After a weary process, and resting every\r\n",
      "five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. My clothes hung loose on\r\n",
      "me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and\r\n",
      "once more, clean and respectable looking—no speck of the dirt, no trace\r\n",
      "of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left—I\r\n",
      "crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow\r\n",
      "low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous\r\n",
      "fire. Hannah was baking. Prejudices, it is well known, are most\r\n",
      "difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been\r\n",
      "loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds\r\n",
      "among stones. Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first:\r\n",
      "latterly she had begun to relent a little; and when she saw me come in\r\n",
      "tidy and well-dressed, she even smiled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, you have got up!” she said. “You are better, then. You may sit\r\n",
      "you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She bustled about,\r\n",
      "examining me every now and then with the corner of her eye. Turning to\r\n",
      "me, as she took some loaves from the oven, she asked bluntly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the\r\n",
      "question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her, I answered\r\n",
      "quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more\r\n",
      "than yourself or your young ladies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After a pause she said, “I dunnut understand that: you’ve like no\r\n",
      "house, nor no brass, I guess?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I was at a boarding-school eight years.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She opened her eyes wide. “Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again. What are\r\n",
      "you going to do with these gooseberries?” I inquired, as she brought\r\n",
      "out a basket of the fruit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mak’ ’em into pies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“But I must do something. Let me have them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by your hands,” she\r\n",

      "much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an\r\n",
      "impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I\r\n",
      "had no ‘brass’ and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived\r\n",
      "have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and\r\n",
      "of as ancient a family as could be found. Marsh End had belonged to the\r\n",
      "Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she affirmed, “aboon two\r\n",
      "hundred year old—for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to\r\n",
      "compare wi’ Mr. Oliver’s grand hall down i’ Morton Vale. But she could\r\n",
      "remember Bill Oliver’s father a journeyman needlemaker; and th’ Rivers\r\n",
      "wor gentry i’ th’ owd days o’ th’ Henrys, as onybody might see by\r\n",
      "looking into th’ registers i’ Morton Church vestry.” Still, she\r\n",
      "allowed, “the owd maister was like other folk—naught mich out o’ t’\r\n",
      "common way: stark mad o’ shooting, and farming, and sich like.” The\r\n",
      "mistress was different. She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and\r\n",
      "the “bairns” had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these\r\n",
      "parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost\r\n",
      "from the time they could speak; and they had always been “of a mak’ of\r\n",
      "their own.” Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a\r\n",
      "parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places\r\n",
      "as governesses: for they had told her their father had some years ago\r\n",
      "lost a great deal of money by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt;\r\n",
      "and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must\r\n",
      "provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long\r\n",
      "while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their\r\n",
      "father’s death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all\r\n",
      "these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and many other\r\n",
      "grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and\r\n",
      "then they were so agreeable with each other—never fell out nor\r\n",
      "“threaped.” She did not know where there was such a family for being\r\n",
      "united.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two\r\n",
      "ladies and their brother were now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour\r\n",
      "to tea.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by\r\n",
      "the kitchen door. Mr. St. John, when he saw me, merely bowed and passed\r\n",
      "through; the two ladies stopped: Mary, in a few words, kindly and\r\n",
      "calmly expressed the pleasure she felt in seeing me well enough to be\r\n",
      "able to come down; Diana took my hand: she shook her head at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should have waited for my leave to descend,” she said. “You still\r\n",
      "look very pale—and so thin! Poor child!—poor girl!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove. She\r\n",
      "possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her whole face\r\n",
      "seemed to me full of charm. Mary’s countenance was equally\r\n",
      "intelligent—her features equally pretty; but her expression was more\r\n",
      "reserved, and her manners, though gentle, more distant. Diana looked\r\n",
      "and spoke with a certain authority: she had a will, evidently. It was\r\n",
      "my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like\r\n",
      "hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to\r\n",
      "an active will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what business have you here?” she continued. “It is not your\r\n",
      "place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like\r\n",
      "to be free, even to license—but you are a visitor, and must go into the\r\n",
      "parlour.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very well here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Besides, the fire is too hot for you,” interposed Mary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure,” added her sister. “Come, you must be obedient.” And still\r\n",
      "holding my hand she made me rise, and led me into the inner room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sit there,” she said, placing me on the sofa, “while we take our\r\n",
      "things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise\r\n",
      "in our little moorland home—to prepare our own meals when we are so\r\n",
      "inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat\r\n",
      "opposite, a book or newspaper in his hand. I examined, first, the\r\n",
      "parlour, and then its occupant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet\r\n",
      "comfortable, because clean and neat. The old-fashioned chairs were very\r\n",
      "bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. A few\r\n",
      "strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated\r\n",
      "the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and\r\n",
      "an ancient set of china. There was no superfluous ornament in the\r\n",
      "room—not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a\r\n",
      "lady’s desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table:\r\n",
      "everything—including the carpet and curtains—looked at once well worn\r\n",
      "and well saved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. St. John—sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the\r\n",
      "walls, keeping his eyes fixed on the page he perused, and his lips\r\n",
      "mutely sealed—was easy enough to examine. Had he been a statue instead\r\n",
      "of a man, he could not have been easier. He was young—perhaps from\r\n",
      "twenty-eight to thirty—tall, slender; his face riveted the eye; it was\r\n",
      "like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic\r\n",
      "nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin. It is seldom, indeed, an\r\n",
      "English face comes so near the antique models as did his. He might well\r\n",
      "be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his own being\r\n",
      "so harmonious. His eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his\r\n",
      "high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by\r\n",
      "careless locks of fair hair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader? Yet he whom it\r\n",
      "describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding,\r\n",
      "an impressible, or even of a placid nature. Quiescent as he now sat,\r\n",
      "there was something about his nostril, his mouth, his brow, which, to\r\n",
      "my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or\r\n",
      "eager. He did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one\r\n",
      "glance, till his sisters returned. Diana, as she passed in and out, in\r\n",
      "the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top\r\n",
      "of the oven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eat that now,” she said: “you must be hungry. Hannah says you have had\r\n",
      "nothing but some gruel since breakfast.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen. Mr. Rivers\r\n",
      "now closed his book, approached the table, and, as he took a seat,\r\n",
      "fixed his blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me. There was an\r\n",
      "unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his\r\n",
      "gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto\r\n",
      "kept it averted from the stranger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are very hungry,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am, sir.” It is my way—it always was my way, by instinct—ever to\r\n",
      "meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the\r\n",
      "last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the\r\n",
      "cravings of your appetite at first. Now you may eat, though still not\r\n",
      "immoderately.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,” was my very\r\n",
      "clumsily-contrived, unpolished answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” he said coolly: “when you have indicated to us the residence of\r\n",
      "your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being\r\n",
      "absolutely without home and friends.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The three looked at me, but not distrustfully; I felt there was no\r\n",
      "suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity. I speak\r\n",
      "particularly of the young ladies. St. John’s eyes, though clear enough\r\n",
      "in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom. He\r\n",
      "seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people’s\r\n",
      "thoughts, than as agents to reveal his own: the which combination of\r\n",
      "keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than\r\n",
      "to encourage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you mean to say,” he asked, “that you are completely isolated from\r\n",
      "every connection?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do. Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess\r\n",
      "to admittance under any roof in England.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A most singular position at your age!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here I saw his glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the\r\n",
      "table before me. I wondered what he sought there: his words soon\r\n",
      "explained the quest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have never been married? You are a spinster?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Diana laughed. “Why, she can’t be above seventeen or eighteen years\r\n",
      "old, St. John,” said she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating\r\n",
      "recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage. They all saw\r\n",
      "the embarrassment and the emotion. Diana and Mary relieved me by\r\n",
      "turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the\r\n",
      "colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he had\r\n",
      "excited forced out tears as well as colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where did you last reside?” he now asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are too inquisitive, St. John,” murmured Mary in a low voice; but\r\n",
      "he leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and\r\n",
      "piercing look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is\r\n",
      "my secret,” I replied concisely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both\r\n",
      "from St. John and every other questioner,” remarked Diana.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,”\r\n",
      "he said. “And you need help, do you not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist\r\n",
      "will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the\r\n",
      "remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries\r\n",
      "of life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid\r\n",
      "you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest. First, then, tell\r\n",
      "me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had now swallowed my tea. I was mightily refreshed by the beverage;\r\n",
      "as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung\r\n",
      "nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge\r\n",
      "steadily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Rivers,” I said, turning to him, and looking at him, as he looked\r\n",
      "at me, openly and without diffidence, “you and your sisters have done\r\n",
      "me a great service—the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have\r\n",
      "rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death. This benefit\r\n",
      "conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to\r\n",
      "a certain extent, on my confidence. I will tell you as much of the\r\n",
      "history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without\r\n",
      "compromising my own peace of mind—my own security, moral and physical,\r\n",
      "and that of others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I\r\n",
      "could know them. I was brought up a dependent; educated in a charitable\r\n",
      "institution. I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where\r\n",
      "I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher—Lowood Orphan\r\n",
      "Asylum, ——shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?—the Rev. Robert\r\n",
      "Brocklehurst is the treasurer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess. I\r\n",
      "obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to\r\n",
      "leave four days before I came here. The reason of my departure I cannot\r\n",
      "and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would\r\n",
      "sound incredible. No blame attached to me: I am as free from\r\n",
      "culpability as any one of you three. Miserable I am, and must be for a\r\n",
      "time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a\r\n",
      "paradise was of a strange and direful nature. I observed but two points\r\n",
      "in planning my departure—speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to\r\n",
      "leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in\r\n",
      "my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that\r\n",
      "brought me to Whitcross. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite\r\n",
      "destitute. I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two\r\n",
      "days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did\r\n",
      "I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and\r\n",
      "despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to\r\n",
      "perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your\r\n",
      "roof. I know all your sisters have done for me since—for I have not\r\n",
      "been insensible during my seeming torpor—and I owe to their\r\n",
      "spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your\r\n",
      "evangelical charity.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t make her talk any more now, St. John,” said Diana, as I paused;\r\n",
      "“she is evidently not yet fit for excitement. Come to the sofa and sit\r\n",
      "down now, Miss Elliott.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the _alias_: I had\r\n",
      "forgotten my new name. Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape,\r\n",
      "noticed it at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You said your name was Jane Elliott?” he observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be\r\n",
      "called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it\r\n",
      "sounds strange to me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your real name you will not give?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would\r\n",
      "lead to it, I avoid.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality—you would\r\n",
      "wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters’ compassion,\r\n",
      "and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the\r\n",
      "distinction drawn, nor do I resent it—it is just): you desire to be\r\n",
      "independent of us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do: I have already said so. Show me how to work, or how to seek\r\n",
      "work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the\r\n",
      "meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another\r\n",

      "John, “as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a\r\n",
      "half-frozen bird some wintry wind might have driven through their\r\n",
      "casement. _I_ feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping\r\n",
      "yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is\r\n",
      "narrow. I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be\r\n",
      "of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of\r\n",

      "The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them.\r\n",
      "In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all\r\n",
      "day, and walk out sometimes. I could join with Diana and Mary in all\r\n",
      "their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid\r\n",
      "them when and where they would allow me. There was a reviving pleasure\r\n",
      "in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time—the\r\n",
      "pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and\r\n",
      "principles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted\r\n",
      "me; what they approved, I reverenced. They loved their sequestered\r\n",
      "home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof,\r\n",
      "its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged\r\n",
      "firs—all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds; its garden,\r\n",
      "dark with yew and holly—and where no flowers but of the hardiest\r\n",
      "species would bloom—found a charm both potent and permanent. They clung\r\n",
      "to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling—to the hollow vale\r\n",
      "into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended,\r\n",
      "and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the\r\n",
      "wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath,\r\n",
      "or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little\r\n",
      "mossy-faced lambs:—they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect\r\n",
      "enthusiasm of attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share\r\n",
      "both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I\r\n",
      "felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline\r\n",
      "of swell and sweep—on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell\r\n",
      "by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,\r\n",
      "and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were\r\n",
      "to them—so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast\r\n",
      "and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of\r\n",
      "sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for\r\n",
      "me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them—wound round my\r\n",
      "faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Indoors we agreed equally well. They were both more accomplished and\r\n",
      "better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of\r\n",
      "knowledge they had trodden before me. I devoured the books they lent\r\n",
      "me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening\r\n",
      "what I had perused during the day. Thought fitted thought; opinion met\r\n",
      "opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.\r\n",
      "Physically, she far excelled me: she was handsome; she was vigorous. In\r\n",
      "her animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of\r\n",
      "flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension. I\r\n",
      "could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of\r\n",
      "vivacity and fluency gone, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana’s\r\n",
      "feet, to rest my head on her knee, and listen alternately to her and\r\n",
      "Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but\r\n",
      "touched. Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her: I\r\n",
      "saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her; that of scholar\r\n",
      "pleased and suited me no less. Our natures dovetailed: mutual\r\n",
      "affection—of the strongest kind—was the result. They discovered I could\r\n",
      "draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service. My\r\n",
      "skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed\r\n",
      "them. Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she would\r\n",
      "take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she made. Thus\r\n",
      "occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks\r\n",
      "like days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and\r\n",
      "rapidly between me and his sisters did not extend to him. One reason of\r\n",
      "the distance yet observed between us was, that he was comparatively\r\n",
      "seldom at home: a large proportion of his time appeared devoted to\r\n",
      "visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his\r\n",
      "parish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No weather seemed to hinder him in these pastoral excursions: rain or\r\n",
      "fair, he would, when his hours of morning study were over, take his\r\n",
      "hat, and, followed by his father’s old pointer, Carlo, go out on his\r\n",
      "mission of love or duty—I scarcely know in which light he regarded it.\r\n",
      "Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his sisters would\r\n",
      "expostulate. He would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than\r\n",
      "cheerful—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from\r\n",
      "these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I\r\n",
      "propose to myself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Diana and Mary’s general answer to this question was a sigh, and some\r\n",
      "minutes of apparently mournful meditation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But besides his frequent absences, there was another barrier to\r\n",
      "friendship with him: he seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even\r\n",
      "of a brooding nature. Zealous in his ministerial labours, blameless in\r\n",
      "his life and habits, he yet did not appear to enjoy that mental\r\n",
      "serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every\r\n",
      "sincere Christian and practical philanthropist. Often, of an evening,\r\n",
      "when he sat at the window, his desk and papers before him, he would\r\n",
      "cease reading or writing, rest his chin on his hand, and deliver\r\n",
      "himself up to I know not what course of thought; but that it was\r\n",
      "perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and\r\n",
      "changeful dilation of his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him that treasury of delight\r\n",
      "it was to his sisters. He expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a\r\n",
      "strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection\r\n",
      "for the dark roof and hoary walls he called his home; but there was\r\n",
      "more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the\r\n",
      "sentiment was manifested; and never did he seem to roam the moors for\r\n",
      "the sake of their soothing silence—never seek out or dwell upon the\r\n",
      "thousand peaceful delights they could yield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Incommunicative as he was, some time elapsed before I had an\r\n",
      "opportunity of gauging his mind. I first got an idea of its calibre\r\n",
      "when I heard him preach in his own church at Morton. I wish I could\r\n",
      "describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render\r\n",
      "faithfully the effect it produced on me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It began calm—and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went,\r\n",
      "it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal\r\n",
      "breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous\r\n",
      "language. This grew to force—compressed, condensed, controlled. The\r\n",
      "heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher:\r\n",
      "neither were softened. Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an\r\n",
      "absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic\r\n",
      "doctrines—election, predestination, reprobation—were frequent; and each\r\n",
      "reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.\r\n",
      "When he had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened\r\n",
      "by his discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed\r\n",
      "to me—I know not whether equally so to others—that the eloquence to\r\n",
      "which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid\r\n",
      "dregs of disappointment—where moved troubling impulses of insatiate\r\n",
      "yearnings and disquieting aspirations. I was sure St. John\r\n",
      "Rivers—pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he was—had not yet found\r\n",
      "that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he had no more found\r\n",
      "it, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my\r\n",
      "broken idol and lost elysium—regrets to which I have latterly avoided\r\n",
      "referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime a month was gone. Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor\r\n",
      "House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited\r\n",
      "them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city,\r\n",
      "where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty\r\n",
      "members they were regarded only as humble dependents, and who neither\r\n",
      "knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only\r\n",
      "their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their\r\n",
      "cook or the taste of their waiting-woman. Mr. St. John had said nothing\r\n",
      "to me yet about the employment he had promised to obtain for me; yet it\r\n",
      "became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind. One morning,\r\n",
      "being left alone with him a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to\r\n",
      "approach the window-recess—which his table, chair, and desk consecrated\r\n",
      "as a kind of study—and I was going to speak, though not very well\r\n",
      "knowing in what words to frame my inquiry—for it is at all times\r\n",
      "difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as\r\n",
      "his—when he saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a\r\n",
      "dialogue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking up as I drew near—“You have a question to ask of me?” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer\r\n",
      "myself to undertake?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you\r\n",
      "seemed both useful and happy here—as my sisters had evidently become\r\n",
      "attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure—I deemed\r\n",
      "it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their\r\n",
      "approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And they will go in three days now?” I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:\r\n",
      "Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I waited a few moments, expecting he would go on with the subject first\r\n",
      "broached: but he seemed to have entered another train of reflection:\r\n",
      "his look denoted abstraction from me and my business. I was obliged to\r\n",
      "recall him to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious\r\n",
      "interest to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers? I hope this delay\r\n",
      "will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give,\r\n",
      "and you to accept.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. I grew\r\n",
      "impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance\r\n",
      "fastened on his face, conveyed the feeling to him as effectually as\r\n",
      "words could have done, and with less trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need be in no hurry to hear,” he said: “let me frankly tell you, I\r\n",
      "have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest. Before I explain,\r\n",
      "recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you,\r\n",
      "it must be as the blind man would help the lame. I am poor; for I find\r\n",
      "that, when I have paid my father’s debts, all the patrimony remaining\r\n",
      "to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind,\r\n",
      "and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in\r\n",
      "front. I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole\r\n",
      "descendants of the race, two earn the dependent’s crust among\r\n",
      "strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native\r\n",
      "country—not only for life, but in death. Yes, and deems, and is bound\r\n",
      "to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day\r\n",
      "when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his\r\n",
      "shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest\r\n",
      "members he is one, shall give the word, ‘Rise, follow Me!’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "St. John said these words as he pronounced his sermons, with a quiet,\r\n",
      "deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of\r\n",
      "glance. He resumed—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service\r\n",
      "of poverty and obscurity. _You_ may even think it degrading—for I see\r\n",
      "now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes\r\n",
      "lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the\r\n",
      "educated; but _I_ consider that no service degrades which can better\r\n",
      "our race. I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the\r\n",
      "Christian labourer’s task of tillage is appointed him—the scantier the\r\n",
      "meed his toil brings—the higher the honour. His, under such\r\n",
      "circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of\r\n",
      "the Gospel were the Apostles—their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer,\r\n",
      "Himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?” I said, as he again paused—“proceed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at me before he proceeded: indeed, he seemed leisurely to\r\n",
      "read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.\r\n",
      "The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he partially expressed in his\r\n",
      "succeeding observations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe you will accept the post I offer you,” said he, “and hold it\r\n",
      "for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently\r\n",
      "keep the narrow and narrowing—the tranquil, hidden office of English\r\n",
      "country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to\r\n",
      "repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do explain,” I urged, when he halted once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,—how trivial—how\r\n",
      "cramping. I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead,\r\n",
      "and that I am my own master. I shall leave the place probably in the\r\n",
      "course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to\r\n",
      "the utmost for its improvement. Morton, when I came to it two years\r\n",
      "ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every\r\n",
      "hope of progress. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a\r\n",
      "second school for girls. I have hired a building for the purpose, with\r\n",
      "a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress’s house. Her\r\n",
      "salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished,\r\n",
      "very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver;\r\n",
      "the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish—Mr. Oliver, the\r\n",
      "proprietor of a needle-factory and iron-foundry in the valley. The same\r\n",
      "lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the\r\n",
      "workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial\r\n",
      "offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation\r\n",
      "of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person. Will\r\n",
      "you be this mistress?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put the question rather hurriedly; he seemed half to expect an\r\n",
      "indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing\r\n",
      "all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he could not tell\r\n",
      "in what light the lot would appear to me. In truth it was humble—but\r\n",
      "then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum: it was plodding—but\r\n",
      "then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was\r\n",
      "independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul\r\n",
      "like iron: it was not ignoble—not unworthy—not mentally degrading, I\r\n",
      "made my decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my\r\n",
      "heart.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you comprehend me?” he said. “It is a village school: your\r\n",
      "scholars will be only poor girls—cottagers’ children—at the best,\r\n",
      "farmers’ daughters. Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will\r\n",
      "be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your\r\n",
      "accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your\r\n",
      "mind—sentiments—tastes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know what you undertake, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased\r\n",
      "and deeply gratified.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And when will you commence the exercise of your function?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like,\r\n",
      "next week.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well: so be it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he again looked at\r\n",

      "his advice that my father risked most of his property in the\r\n",
      "speculation that ruined him. Mutual recrimination passed between them:\r\n",
      "they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged\r\n",
      "afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a\r\n",
      "fortune of twenty thousand pounds. He was never married, and had no\r\n",
      "near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely\r\n",
      "related than we. My father always cherished the idea that he would\r\n",
      "atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter\r\n",
      "informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation,\r\n",
      "with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John,\r\n",
      "Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings. He\r\n",
      "had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp\r\n",
      "is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news. Mary and I would\r\n",
      "have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St.\r\n",

      "My home, then, when I at last find a home,—is a cottage; a little room\r\n",
      "with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted\r\n",
      "chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and\r\n",
      "dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf. Above, a chamber of the same\r\n",
      "dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers;\r\n",
      "small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the\r\n",
      "kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a\r\n",
      "modest stock of such things as are necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is evening. I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little\r\n",
      "orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth.\r\n",
      "This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But\r\n",
      "three of the number can read: none write or cipher. Several knit, and a\r\n",
      "few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district.\r\n",
      "At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other’s\r\n",
      "language. Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as\r\n",
      "ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a\r\n",
      "disposition that pleases me. I must not forget that these coarsely-clad\r\n",
      "little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of\r\n",
      "gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence,\r\n",
      "refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their\r\n",
      "hearts as in those of the best-born. My duty will be to develop these\r\n",
      "germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office.\r\n",
      "Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it\r\n",
      "will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought,\r\n",
      "yield me enough to live on from day to day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in\r\n",
      "yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon? Not to\r\n",
      "deceive myself, I must reply—No: I felt desolate to a degree. I\r\n",
      "felt—yes, idiot that I am—I felt degraded. I doubted I had taken a step\r\n",
      "which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I\r\n",
      "was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of\r\n",

      "too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong—that is a great\r\n",
      "step gained; I shall strive to overcome them. To-morrow, I trust, I\r\n",
      "shall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps,\r\n",
      "they will be quite subdued. In a few months, it is possible, the\r\n",

      "asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst\r\n",
      "the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France,\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester’s mistress; delirious with his love half my time—for he\r\n",
      "would—oh, yes, he would have loved me well for a while. He _did_ love\r\n",

      "homage given to beauty, youth, and grace—for never to any one else\r\n",

      "slave in a fool’s paradise at Marseilles—fevered with delusive bliss\r\n",
      "one hour—suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the\r\n",

      "mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law,\r\n",

      "grief and fatal fury—consequences of my departure—which might now,\r\n",
      "perhaps, be dragging him from the path of right, too far to leave hope\r\n",
      "of ultimate restoration thither. At this thought, I turned my face\r\n",
      "aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton—I say\r\n",
      "_lonely_, for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building\r\n",
      "apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and,\r\n",
      "quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr.\r\n",
      "Oliver and his daughter lived. I hid my eyes, and leant my head against\r\n",
      "the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket\r\n",
      "which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.\r\n",
      "A dog—old Carlo, Mr. Rivers’ pointer, as I saw in a moment—was pushing\r\n",
      "the gate with his nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded\r\n",
      "arms; his brow knit, his gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on\r\n",
      "me. I asked him to come in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters\r\n",
      "left for you. I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. He examined my face, I\r\n",

      "nothing—I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance,\r\n",

      "strains after a path we may not follow—we need neither starve from\r\n",
      "inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another\r\n",
      "nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to\r\n",

      "author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart\r\n",
      "of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown,\r\n",
      "a luster after power, beat under my curate’s surplice. I considered; my\r\n",
      "life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die. After a season\r\n",
      "of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped\r\n",

      "which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and\r\n",
      "eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator,\r\n",

      "My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I\r\n",
      "have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a\r\n",
      "successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings\r\n",

      "which the speaker had surprised him—his arm resting on the gate, his\r\n",
      "face directed towards the west. He turned at last, with measured\r\n",
      "deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his side.\r\n",
      "There appeared, within three feet of him, a form clad in pure white—a\r\n",
      "youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after\r\n",
      "bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long\r\n",
      "veil, there bloomed under his glance a face of perfect beauty. Perfect\r\n",
      "beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as\r\n",

      "hues of rose and lily as ever her humid gales and vapoury skies\r\n",
      "generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term. No charm\r\n",
      "was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and\r\n",
      "delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely\r\n",
      "pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which\r\n",
      "encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow\r\n",
      "which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such\r\n",
      "repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh,\r\n",
      "and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the\r\n",

      "ornament of rich, plenteous tresses—all advantages, in short, which,\r\n",
      "combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers. I wondered, as\r\n",
      "I looked at this fair creature: I admired her with my whole heart.\r\n",
      "Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her\r\n",
      "usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her darling,\r\n",
      "with a grand-dame’s bounty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel? I naturally asked\r\n",
      "myself that question as I saw him turn to her and look at her; and, as\r\n",
      "naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his countenance. He\r\n",
      "had already withdrawn his eye from the Peri, and was looking at a\r\n",
      "humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,” he said, as he\r\n",
      "crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his foot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I only came home from S——” (she mentioned the name of a large town\r\n",
      "some twenty miles distant) “this afternoon. Papa told me you had opened\r\n",
      "your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my\r\n",
      "bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?”\r\n",
      "pointing to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is,” said St. John.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you think you shall like Morton?” she asked of me, with a direct\r\n",
      "and naïve simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope I shall. I have many inducements to do so.”\r\n",

      "is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of\r\n",
      "fortune, as well as in those of nature! What happy combination of the\r\n",
      "planets presided over her birth, I wonder?)\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,” she added. “It will\r\n",
      "be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change. Mr.\r\n",
      "Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S——. Last night, or\r\n",
      "rather this morning, I was dancing till two o’clock. The ——th regiment\r\n",
      "are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most\r\n",
      "agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and\r\n",
      "scissor merchants to shame.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It seemed to me that Mr. St. John’s under lip protruded, and his upper\r\n",
      "lip curled a moment. His mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed,\r\n",
      "and the lower part of his face unusually stern and square, as the\r\n",
      "laughing girl gave him this information. He lifted his gaze, too, from\r\n",
      "the daisies, and turned it on her. An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning\r\n",
      "gaze it was. She answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well\r\n",
      "became her youth, her roses, her dimples, her bright eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he stood, mute and grave, she again fell to caressing Carlo. “Poor\r\n",
      "Carlo loves me,” said she. “_He_ is not stern and distant to his\r\n",
      "friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she patted the dog’s head, bending with native grace before his\r\n",
      "young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master’s face. I\r\n",
      "saw his solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless\r\n",
      "emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he looked nearly as beautiful for a\r\n",
      "man as she for a woman. His chest heaved once, as if his large heart,\r\n",
      "weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and\r\n",
      "made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty. But he curbed it,\r\n",
      "I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He responded\r\n",
      "neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Papa says you never come to see us now,” continued Miss Oliver,\r\n",
      "looking up. “You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall. He is alone this\r\n",
      "evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,” answered St.\r\n",
      "John.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. It is just the hour when\r\n",
      "papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no\r\n",
      "business to occupy him. Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come. Why are you so very\r\n",
      "shy, and so very sombre?” She filled up the hiatus his silence left by\r\n",
      "a reply of her own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I forgot!” she exclaimed, shaking her beautiful curled head, as if\r\n",
      "shocked at herself. “I am so giddy and thoughtless! _Do_ excuse me. It\r\n",
      "had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for\r\n",
      "joining in my chatter. Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is\r\n",
      "shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you. Do come and see\r\n",
      "papa.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay\r\n",
      "any longer: the dew begins to fall. Good evening!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held out her hand. He just touched it. “Good evening!” he repeated,\r\n",
      "in a voice low and hollow as an echo. She turned, but in a moment\r\n",
      "returned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you well?” she asked. Well might she put the question: his face\r\n",
      "was blanched as her gown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite well,” he enunciated; and, with a bow, he left the gate. She\r\n",
      "went one way; he another. She turned twice to gaze after him as she\r\n",
      "tripped fairy-like down the field; he, as he strode firmly across,\r\n",
      "never turned at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This spectacle of another’s suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and\r\n",
      "faithfully as I could. It was truly hard work at first. Some time\r\n",
      "elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and\r\n",
      "their nature. Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed\r\n",
      "to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon\r\n",
      "found I was mistaken. There was a difference amongst them as amongst\r\n",
      "the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference\r\n",
      "rapidly developed itself. Their amazement at me, my language, my rules,\r\n",
      "and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping\r\n",
      "rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough. Many showed themselves\r\n",
      "obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few\r\n",
      "examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of\r\n",
      "excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration. These\r\n",
      "soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons\r\n",
      "neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly\r\n",
      "manners. The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even\r\n",
      "surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I\r\n",
      "began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me. I\r\n",
      "had amongst my scholars several farmers’ daughters: young women grown,\r\n",
      "almost. These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught\r\n",
      "the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of\r\n",
      "needlework. I found estimable characters amongst them—characters\r\n",
      "desirous of information and disposed for improvement—with whom I passed\r\n",
      "many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes. Their parents then\r\n",
      "(the farmer and his wife) loaded me with attentions. There was an\r\n",
      "enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a\r\n",
      "consideration—a scrupulous regard to their feelings—to which they were\r\n",
      "not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and\r\n",
      "benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it\r\n",
      "made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out,\r\n",
      "I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with\r\n",
      "friendly smiles. To live amidst general regard, though it be but the\r\n",
      "regard of working people, is like “sitting in sunshine, calm and\r\n",
      "sweet;” serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray. At this\r\n",
      "period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than\r\n",
      "sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of\r\n",
      "this calm, this useful existence—after a day passed in honourable\r\n",
      "exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading\r\n",
      "contentedly alone—I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams\r\n",
      "many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the\r\n",
      "stormy—dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure,\r\n",
      "with agitating risk and romantic chance, I still again and again met\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of\r\n",
      "being in his arms, hearing his voice, meeting his eye, touching his\r\n",
      "hand and cheek, loving him, being loved by him—the hope of passing a\r\n",
      "lifetime at his side, would be renewed, with all its first force and\r\n",
      "fire. Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated. Then\r\n",
      "I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the\r\n",
      "still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the\r\n",
      "burst of passion. By nine o’clock the next morning I was punctually\r\n",
      "opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties\r\n",
      "of the day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Rosamond Oliver kept her word in coming to visit me. Her call at the\r\n",
      "school was generally made in the course of her morning ride. She would\r\n",
      "canter up to the door on her pony, followed by a mounted livery\r\n",
      "servant. Anything more exquisite than her appearance, in her purple\r\n",
      "habit, with her Amazon’s cap of black velvet placed gracefully above\r\n",
      "the long curls that kissed her cheek and floated to her shoulders, can\r\n",
      "scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she would enter the rustic\r\n",
      "building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.\r\n",
      "She generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving\r\n",
      "his daily catechising lesson. Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the\r\n",
      "visitress pierce the young pastor’s heart. A sort of instinct seemed to\r\n",
      "warn him of her entrance, even when he did not see it; and when he was\r\n",
      "looking quite away from the door, if she appeared at it, his cheek\r\n",
      "would glow, and his marble-seeming features, though they refused to\r\n",
      "relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became\r\n",
      "expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or\r\n",
      "darting glance could indicate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, she knew her power: indeed, he did not, because he could\r\n",
      "not, conceal it from her. In spite of his Christian stoicism, when she\r\n",
      "went up and addressed him, and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly\r\n",
      "in his face, his hand would tremble and his eye burn. He seemed to say,\r\n",
      "with his sad and resolute look, if he did not say it with his lips, “I\r\n",
      "love you, and I know you prefer me. It is not despair of success that\r\n",
      "keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.\r\n",
      "But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged\r\n",
      "round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then she would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud\r\n",
      "would soften her radiant vivacity; she would withdraw her hand hastily\r\n",
      "from his, and turn in transient petulance from his aspect, at once so\r\n",
      "heroic and so martyr-like. St. John, no doubt, would have given the\r\n",
      "world to follow, recall, retain her, when she thus left him; but he\r\n",
      "would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of\r\n",
      "her love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise. Besides, he could not\r\n",
      "bind all that he had in his nature—the rover, the aspirant, the poet,\r\n",
      "the priest—in the limits of a single passion. He could not—he would\r\n",
      "not—renounce his wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the\r\n",
      "peace of Vale Hall. I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once,\r\n",
      "despite his reserve, had the daring to make on his confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. I\r\n",
      "had learnt her whole character, which was without mystery or disguise:\r\n",
      "she was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly\r\n",
      "selfish. She had been indulged from her birth, but was not absolutely\r\n",
      "spoilt. She was hasty, but good-humoured; vain (she could not help it,\r\n",
      "when every glance in the glass showed her such a flush of loveliness),\r\n",
      "but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth;\r\n",
      "ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she\r\n",
      "was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her own sex\r\n",
      "like me; but she was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly\r\n",
      "impressive. A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for\r\n",
      "instance, of the sisters of St. John. Still, I liked her almost as I\r\n",
      "liked my pupil Adèle; except that, for a child whom we have watched\r\n",
      "over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an\r\n",
      "equally attractive adult acquaintance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had taken an amiable caprice to me. She said I was like Mr. Rivers,\r\n",
      "only, certainly, she allowed, “not one-tenth so handsome, though I was\r\n",
      "a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.” I was, however,\r\n",
      "good, clever, composed, and firm, like him. I was a _lusus naturæ_, she\r\n",
      "affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she was sure my previous\r\n",
      "history, if known, would make a delightful romance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, while, with her usual child-like activity, and thoughtless\r\n",
      "yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she was rummaging the cupboard and\r\n",
      "the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she discovered first two French\r\n",
      "books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then\r\n",
      "my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a\r\n",
      "pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views\r\n",
      "from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.\r\n",
      "She was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with\r\n",
      "delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a\r\n",
      "love—what a miracle I was! I drew better than her master in the first\r\n",
      "school in S——. Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With pleasure,” I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at\r\n",
      "the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model. She had then\r\n",
      "on a dark-blue silk dress; her arms and her neck were bare; her only\r\n",
      "ornament was her chestnut tresses, which waved over her shoulders with\r\n",
      "all the wild grace of natural curls. I took a sheet of fine card-board,\r\n",
      "and drew a careful outline. I promised myself the pleasure of colouring\r\n",
      "it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her she must come and sit\r\n",
      "another day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made such a report of me to her father, that Mr. Oliver himself\r\n",
      "accompanied her next evening—a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and\r\n",
      "grey-headed man, at whose side his lovely daughter looked like a bright\r\n",
      "flower near a hoary turret. He appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud\r\n",
      "personage; but he was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond’s\r\n",
      "portrait pleased him highly: he said I must make a finished picture of\r\n",
      "it. He insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at\r\n",
      "Vale Hall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant\r\n",
      "evidences of wealth in the proprietor. Rosamond was full of glee and\r\n",
      "pleasure all the time I stayed. Her father was affable; and when he\r\n",
      "entered into conversation with me after tea, he expressed in strong\r\n",
      "terms his approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he\r\n",
      "only feared, from what he saw and heard, I was too good for the place,\r\n",
      "and would soon quit it for one more suitable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed,” cried Rosamond, “she is clever enough to be a governess in a\r\n",
      "high family, papa.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in\r\n",
      "the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers—of the Rivers family—with\r\n",
      "great respect. He said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood;\r\n",
      "that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once\r\n",
      "belonged to them; that even now he considered the representative of\r\n",
      "that house might, if he liked, make an alliance with the best. He\r\n",
      "accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have\r\n",
      "formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a\r\n",
      "valuable life away. It appeared, then, that her father would throw no\r\n",
      "obstacle in the way of Rosamond’s union with St. John. Mr. Oliver\r\n",
      "evidently regarded the young clergyman’s good birth, old name, and\r\n",
      "sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the 5th of November, and a holiday. My little servant, after\r\n",
      "helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of\r\n",
      "a penny for her aid. All about me was spotless and bright—scoured\r\n",
      "floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself\r\n",
      "neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got\r\n",
      "my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier\r\n",
      "occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver’s miniature. The head was\r\n",
      "finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery\r\n",
      "to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips—a soft\r\n",
      "curl here and there to the tresses—a deeper tinge to the shadow of the\r\n",
      "lash under the azured eyelid. I was absorbed in the execution of these\r\n",
      "nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting\r\n",
      "St. John Rivers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,” he said. “Not, I\r\n",
      "hope, in thought? No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel\r\n",
      "lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up\r\n",
      "wonderfully so far. I have brought you a book for evening solace,” and\r\n",
      "he laid on the table a new publication—a poem: one of those genuine\r\n",

      "at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make\r\n",
      "me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should\r\n",

      "strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had\r\n",

      "more profound and potent than they are. You give me a larger allowance\r\n",
      "of sympathy than I have a just claim to. When I colour, and when I\r\n",
      "shake before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself. I scorn the weakness. I\r\n",
      "know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the\r\n",

      "deformity—a cold, hard, ambitious man. Natural affection only, of all\r\n",
      "the sentiments, has permanent power over me. Reason, and not feeling,\r\n",
      "is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do\r\n",
      "more than others, insatiable. I honour endurance, perseverance,\r\n",
      "industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve\r\n",
      "great ends and mount to lofty eminence. I watch your career with\r\n",
      "interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly,\r\n",

      "has cultivated my original qualities thus:—From the minute germ,\r\n",
      "natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree,\r\n",
      "philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has\r\n",
      "reared a due sense of the Divine justice. Of the ambition to win power\r\n",
      "and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread\r\n",
      "my Master’s kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the\r\n",
      "cross. So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials\r\n",
      "to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she could not\r\n",

      "up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me,\r\n",
      "inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that\r\n",
      "seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and\r\n",

      "the thought that rushed upon me—that embodied itself,—that, in a\r\n",
      "second, stood out a strong, solid probability. Circumstances knit\r\n",
      "themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been\r\n",
      "lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,—every\r\n",
      "ring was perfect, the connection complete. I knew, by instinct, how the\r\n",

      "And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was\r\n",
      "delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had\r\n",

      "furniture: my cousins having given me _carte blanche_ to effect what\r\n",
      "alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that\r\n",

      "were: for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing\r\n",
      "again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the\r\n",
      "spectacle of the smartest innovations. Still some novelty was\r\n",
      "necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it\r\n",

      "of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze,\r\n",
      "new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables,\r\n",
      "answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring. A spare\r\n",
      "parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and\r\n",
      "crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the\r\n",
      "stairs. When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model\r\n",

      "commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls\r\n",
      "sufficed to scare him to estrangement. He found me in the kitchen,\r\n",

      "general inspection of the result of my labours. With some difficulty, I\r\n",

      "no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously\r\n",
      "respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed\r\n",
      "more thought on the matter than it was worth. How many minutes, for\r\n",
      "instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very\r\n",
      "room?—By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I showed him the volume on the shelf: he took it down, and withdrawing\r\n",
      "to his accustomed window recess, he began to read it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, I did not like this, reader. St. John was a good man; but I began\r\n",
      "to feel he had spoken truth of himself when he said he was hard and\r\n",
      "cold. The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for\r\n",
      "him—its peaceful enjoyments no charm. Literally, he lived only to\r\n",
      "aspire—after what was good and great, certainly; but still he would\r\n",
      "never rest, nor approve of others resting round him. As I looked at his\r\n",
      "lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone—at his fine lineaments\r\n",
      "fixed in study—I comprehended all at once that he would hardly make a\r\n",
      "good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I\r\n",
      "understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his love for Miss Oliver;\r\n",
      "I agreed with him that it was but a love of the senses. I comprehended\r\n",
      "how he should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised\r\n",
      "over him; how he should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he should\r\n",
      "mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his happiness or hers. I\r\n",
      "saw he was of the material from which nature hews her heroes—Christian\r\n",
      "and Pagan—her lawgivers, her statesmen, her conquerors: a steadfast\r\n",
      "bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too\r\n",
      "often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This parlour is not his sphere,” I reflected: “the Himalayan ridge or\r\n",
      "Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him\r\n",
      "better. Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his\r\n",
      "element: there his faculties stagnate—they cannot develop or appear to\r\n",
      "advantage. It is in scenes of strife and danger—where courage is\r\n",
      "proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked—that he will speak\r\n",
      "and move, the leader and superior. A merry child would have the\r\n",
      "advantage of him on this hearth. He is right to choose a missionary’s\r\n",
      "career—I see it now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are coming! they are coming!” cried Hannah, throwing open the\r\n",
      "parlour door. At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran.\r\n",
      "It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible. Hannah soon had\r\n",
      "a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened\r\n",
      "the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out. In a\r\n",
      "minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary’s\r\n",
      "soft cheek, then with Diana’s flowing curls. They laughed—kissed\r\n",
      "me—then Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked\r\n",
      "eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened\r\n",
      "into the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and\r\n",
      "chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances\r\n",
      "expanded to the cheerful firelight. While the driver and Hannah brought\r\n",
      "in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he advanced from\r\n",
      "the parlour. They both threw their arms round his neck at once. He gave\r\n",
      "each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a\r\n",
      "while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he supposed they would\r\n",
      "soon rejoin him in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give\r\n",
      "hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.\r\n",
      "They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms;\r\n",
      "with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases:\r\n",
      "they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly. I had the pleasure of\r\n",
      "feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I\r\n",
      "had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so\r\n",
      "eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St.\r\n",
      "John’s taciturnity: he was sincerely glad to see his sisters; but in\r\n",
      "their glow of fervour and flow of joy he could not sympathise. The\r\n",
      "event of the day—that is, the return of Diana and Mary—pleased him; but\r\n",
      "the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee\r\n",
      "of reception irked him: I saw he wished the calmer morrow was come. In\r\n",
      "the very meridian of the night’s enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a\r\n",
      "rap was heard at the door. Hannah entered with the intimation that “a\r\n",
      "poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see\r\n",
      "his mother, who was drawing away.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where does she live, Hannah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss\r\n",
      "all the way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell him I will go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m sure, sir, you had better not. It’s the worst road to travel after\r\n",
      "dark that can be: there’s no track at all over the bog. And then it is\r\n",
      "such a bitter night—the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send\r\n",
      "word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he was already in the passage, putting on his cloak; and without\r\n",
      "one objection, one murmur, he departed. It was then nine o’clock: he\r\n",
      "did not return till midnight. Starved and tired enough he was: but he\r\n",
      "looked happier than when he set out. He had performed an act of duty;\r\n",
      "made an exertion; felt his own strength to do and deny, and was on\r\n",
      "better terms with himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his patience. It was\r\n",
      "Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a\r\n",
      "sort of merry domestic dissipation. The air of the moors, the freedom\r\n",
      "of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary’s spirits like\r\n",
      "some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from\r\n",
      "noon till night. They could always talk; and their discourse, witty,\r\n",
      "pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to,\r\n",
      "and sharing in it, to doing anything else. St. John did not rebuke our\r\n",
      "vivacity; but he escaped from it: he was seldom in the house; his\r\n",
      "parish was large, the population scattered, and he found daily business\r\n",
      "in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for\r\n",
      "some minutes, asked him, “If his plans were yet unchanged.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Unchanged and unchangeable,” was the reply. And he proceeded to inform\r\n",
      "us that his departure from England was now definitively fixed for the\r\n",
      "ensuing year.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And Rosamond Oliver?” suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her\r\n",
      "lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she uttered them, than she made a\r\n",
      "gesture as if wishing to recall them. St. John had a book in his\r\n",
      "hand—it was his unsocial custom to read at meals—he closed it, and\r\n",
      "looked up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rosamond Oliver,” said he, “is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one\r\n",
      "of the best connected and most estimable residents in S——, grandson and\r\n",
      "heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father\r\n",
      "yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him:\r\n",
      "he was serene as glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The match must have been got up hastily,” said Diana: “they cannot\r\n",
      "have known each other long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S——. But\r\n",
      "where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where\r\n",
      "the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary:\r\n",
      "they will be married as soon as S—— Place, which Sir Frederic gives up\r\n",
      "to them, can be refitted for their reception.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt\r\n",
      "tempted to inquire if the event distressed him: but he seemed so little\r\n",
      "to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him more, I\r\n",
      "experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already\r\n",
      "hazarded. Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him: his reserve\r\n",
      "was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it. He\r\n",
      "had not kept his promise of treating me like his sisters; he\r\n",
      "continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not\r\n",
      "at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was\r\n",
      "acknowledged his kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him, I\r\n",
      "felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he had known\r\n",
      "me only as the village schoolmistress. When I remembered how far I had\r\n",
      "once been admitted to his confidence, I could hardly comprehend his\r\n",
      "present frigidity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he raised his\r\n",
      "head suddenly from the desk over which he was stooping, and said—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a\r\n",
      "moment’s hesitation I answered—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose\r\n",
      "triumphs have cost them too dear? Would not such another ruin you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be\r\n",
      "called upon to contend for such another. The event of the conflict is\r\n",
      "decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!” So saying, he\r\n",
      "returned to his papers and his silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As our mutual happiness (_i.e._, Diana’s, Mary’s, and mine) settled\r\n",
      "into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular\r\n",
      "studies, St. John stayed more at home: he sat with us in the same room,\r\n",
      "sometimes for hours together. While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course\r\n",
      "of encyclopædic reading she had (to my awe and amazement) undertaken,\r\n",
      "and I fagged away at German, he pondered a mystic lore of his own: that\r\n",
      "of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he thought necessary\r\n",
      "to his plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus engaged, he appeared, sitting in his own recess, quiet and\r\n",
      "absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his had a habit of leaving the\r\n",
      "outlandish-looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing\r\n",
      "upon us, his fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation:\r\n",
      "if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it\r\n",
      "returned searchingly to our table. I wondered what it meant: I\r\n",
      "wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he never failed to exhibit\r\n",
      "on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly\r\n",
      "visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day\r\n",
      "was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his\r\n",
      "sisters urged me not to go, he would invariably make light of their\r\n",
      "solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to\r\n",
      "the elements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,” he would say: “she\r\n",
      "can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as\r\n",
      "well as any of us. Her constitution is both sound and elastic;—better\r\n",
      "calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little\r\n",
      "weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur\r\n",
      "would be to vex him: on all occasions fortitude pleased him; the\r\n",
      "reverse was a special annoyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really\r\n",
      "had a cold. His sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading\r\n",
      "Schiller; he, deciphering his crabbed Oriental scrolls. As I exchanged\r\n",
      "a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his way: there I\r\n",
      "found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye. How\r\n",
      "long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I\r\n",
      "cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment\r\n",
      "superstitious—as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, what are you doing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Learning German.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not in earnest?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he was\r\n",
      "himself at present studying; that, as he advanced, he was apt to forget\r\n",
      "the commencement; that it would assist him greatly to have a pupil with\r\n",
      "whom he might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them\r\n",
      "thoroughly in his mind; that his choice had hovered for some time\r\n",
      "between me and his sisters; but that he had fixed on me because he saw\r\n",
      "I could sit at a task the longest of the three. Would I do him this\r\n",
      "favour? I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it\r\n",
      "wanted now barely three months to his departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every\r\n",
      "impression made on him, either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved\r\n",
      "and permanent. I consented. When Diana and Mary returned, the former\r\n",
      "found her scholar transferred from her to her brother: she laughed, and\r\n",
      "both she and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them\r\n",
      "to such a step. He answered quietly—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I found him a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting\r\n",
      "master: he expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his\r\n",
      "expectations, he, in his own way, fully testified his approbation. By\r\n",
      "degrees, he acquired a certain influence over me that took away my\r\n",
      "liberty of mind: his praise and notice were more restraining than his\r\n",
      "indifference. I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he was by,\r\n",
      "because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity (at\r\n",
      "least in me) was distasteful to him. I was so fully aware that only\r\n",
      "serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his presence\r\n",
      "every effort to sustain or follow any other became vain: I fell under a\r\n",
      "freezing spell. When he said “go,” I went; “come,” I came; “do this,” I\r\n",
      "did it. But I did not love my servitude: I wished, many a time, he had\r\n",
      "continued to neglect me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening when, at bedtime, his sisters and I stood round him,\r\n",
      "bidding him good-night, he kissed each of them, as was his custom; and,\r\n",
      "as was equally his custom, he gave me his hand. Diana, who chanced to\r\n",
      "be in a frolicsome humour (_she_ was not painfully controlled by his\r\n",
      "will; for hers, in another way, was as strong), exclaimed—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don’t treat\r\n",
      "her as such: you should kiss her too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pushed me towards him. I thought Diana very provoking, and felt\r\n",
      "uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St.\r\n",
      "John bent his head; his Greek face was brought to a level with mine,\r\n",
      "his eyes questioned my eyes piercingly—he kissed me. There are no such\r\n",
      "things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my\r\n",
      "ecclesiastical cousin’s salute belonged to one of these classes; but\r\n",
      "there may be experiment kisses, and his was an experiment kiss. When\r\n",
      "given, he viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure\r\n",
      "I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt\r\n",
      "as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters. He never omitted the\r\n",
      "ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I\r\n",
      "underwent it, seemed to invest it for him with a certain charm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for me, I daily wished more to please him; but to do so, I felt\r\n",
      "daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my\r\n",
      "faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to\r\n",
      "the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation. He wanted\r\n",
      "to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to\r\n",
      "aspire to the standard he uplifted. The thing was as impossible as to\r\n",
      "mould my irregular features to his correct and classic pattern, to give\r\n",
      "to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his\r\n",
      "own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not his ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Of\r\n",
      "late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat\r\n",
      "at my heart and drained my happiness at its source—the evil of\r\n",
      "suspense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these\r\n",
      "changes of place and fortune. Not for a moment. His idea was still with\r\n",
      "me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a\r\n",
      "sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a\r\n",
      "tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed. The craving\r\n",
      "to know what had become of him followed me everywhere; when I was at\r\n",
      "Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now\r\n",
      "at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the\r\n",
      "will, I had inquired if he knew anything of Mr. Rochester’s present\r\n",
      "residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he was\r\n",
      "quite ignorant of all concerning him. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax,\r\n",
      "entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty\r\n",
      "on this step answering my end: I felt sure it would elicit an early\r\n",
      "answer. I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but\r\n",
      "when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and\r\n",
      "brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.\r\n",
      "Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some\r\n",
      "weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word\r\n",
      "reached me. When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died\r\n",
      "out, and then I felt dark indeed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy. Summer\r\n",
      "approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she said I looked ill, and wished\r\n",
      "to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he said I did\r\n",
      "not want dissipation, I wanted employment; my present life was too\r\n",
      "purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb\r\n",
      "was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment. Hannah had told me\r\n",
      "in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take\r\n",
      "it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me\r\n",
      "at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.\r\n",
      "The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring\r\n",

      "my eyes filled again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her music in the\r\n",
      "drawing-room, Mary was gardening—it was a very fine May day, clear,\r\n",
      "sunny, and breezy. My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion,\r\n",
      "nor did he question me as to its cause; he only said—\r\n",

      "“We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.” And\r\n",
      "while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he sat calm and patient,\r\n",
      "leaning on his desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye\r\n",
      "of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient’s\r\n",
      "malady. Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something\r\n",
      "about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and\r\n",
      "succeeded in completing it. St. John put away my books and his, locked\r\n",
      "his desk, and said—\r\n",

      "“Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.”\r\n",

      "sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither\r\n",

      "clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the\r\n",

      "mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag\r\n",
      "for gem—where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the\r\n",

      "traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he removed his hat,\r\n",
      "let the breeze stir his hair and kiss his brow. He seemed in communion\r\n",

      "blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more\r\n",
      "effect on him than if his heart had been really a matter of stone or\r\n",

      "some means that doubt is removed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "looking very thoughtful. Diana was a great deal taller than I: she put\r\n",
      "her hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting\r\n",
      "you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest\r\n",

      "he, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Diana clapped her hands. “That is just what we hoped and thought! And\r\n",
      "you will marry him, Jane, won’t you? And then he will stay in England.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a\r\n",
      "fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! He wishes you to go to India?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madness!” she exclaimed. “You would not live three months there, I am\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I have refused to marry him—”\r\n",

      "strong, and you are weak. St. John—you know him—would urge you to\r\n",
      "impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during\r\n",
      "the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts,\r\n",
      "you force yourself to perform. I am astonished you found courage to\r\n",
      "refuse his hand. You do not love him then, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not as a husband.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Plain! You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good,\r\n",
      "to be grilled alive in Calcutta.” And again she earnestly conjured me\r\n",
      "to give up all thoughts of going out with her brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must indeed,” I said; “for when just now I repeated the offer of\r\n",
      "serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of\r\n",
      "decency. He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing\r\n",
      "to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to\r\n",
      "find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should hear himself on the subject. He has again and again\r\n",
      "explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate. He\r\n",
      "has told me I am formed for labour—not for love: which is true, no\r\n",
      "doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that\r\n",
      "I am not formed for marriage. Would it not be strange, Die, to be\r\n",
      "chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Insupportable—unnatural—out of the question!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And then,” I continued, “though I have only sisterly affection for him\r\n",
      "now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of\r\n",
      "conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him,\r\n",
      "because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur\r\n",
      "in his look, manner, and conversation. In that case, my lot would\r\n",
      "become unspeakably wretched. He would not want me to love him; and if I\r\n",
      "showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a\r\n",
      "superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me. I know he would.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And yet St. John is a good man,” said Diana.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings\r\n",
      "and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views. It is\r\n",
      "better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest,\r\n",
      "in his progress, he should trample them down. Here he comes! I will\r\n",
      "leave you, Diana.” And I hastened upstairs as I saw him entering the\r\n",
      "garden.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I was forced to meet him again at supper. During that meal he\r\n",
      "appeared just as composed as usual. I had thought he would hardly speak\r\n",
      "to me, and I was certain he had given up the pursuit of his matrimonial\r\n",
      "scheme: the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points. He addressed\r\n",
      "me precisely in his ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his\r\n",
      "ordinary manner—one scrupulously polite. No doubt he had invoked the\r\n",
      "help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him, and\r\n",
      "now believed he had forgiven me once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the evening reading before prayers, he selected the twenty-first\r\n",
      "chapter of Revelation. It was at all times pleasant to listen while\r\n",
      "from his lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his fine voice\r\n",
      "sound at once so sweet and full—never did his manner become so\r\n",
      "impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he delivered the oracles of\r\n",
      "God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone—that manner a more\r\n",
      "thrilling meaning—as he sat in the midst of his household circle (the\r\n",
      "May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering\r\n",
      "almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table): as he sat\r\n",
      "there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page\r\n",
      "the vision of the new heaven and the new earth—told how God would come\r\n",
      "to dwell with men, how He would wipe away all tears from their eyes,\r\n",
      "and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor\r\n",
      "crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he spoke them: especially\r\n",
      "as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in\r\n",
      "uttering them, his eye had turned on me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God,\r\n",
      "and he shall be my son. But,” was slowly, distinctly read, “the\r\n",
      "fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which\r\n",
      "burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his\r\n",
      "enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter. The reader\r\n",
      "believed his name was already written in the Lamb’s book of life, and\r\n",
      "he yearned after the hour which should admit him to the city to which\r\n",
      "the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need\r\n",
      "of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it,\r\n",
      "and the Lamb is the light thereof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the prayer following the chapter, all his energy gathered—all his\r\n",
      "stern zeal woke: he was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and\r\n",
      "resolved on a conquest. He supplicated strength for the weak-hearted;\r\n",
      "guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh\r\n",
      "hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were\r\n",
      "luring from the narrow path. He asked, he urged, he claimed the boon of\r\n",
      "a brand snatched from the burning. Earnestness is ever deeply solemn:\r\n",
      "first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his; then, when it\r\n",
      "continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed. He felt the\r\n",
      "greatness and goodness of his purpose so sincerely: others who heard\r\n",
      "him plead for it, could not but feel it too.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prayer over, we took leave of him: he was to go at a very early\r\n",
      "hour in the morning. Diana and Mary having kissed him, left the room—in\r\n",
      "compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him: I tendered my\r\n",
      "hand, and wished him a pleasant journey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a\r\n",
      "fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection. If I\r\n",
      "listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with\r\n",
      "me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim—to\r\n",
      "do all things to the glory of God. My Master was long-suffering: so\r\n",
      "will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath:\r\n",
      "repent—resolve, while there is yet time. Remember, we are bid to work\r\n",
      "while it is day—warned that ‘the night cometh when no man shall work.’\r\n",
      "Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life. God\r\n",
      "give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken\r\n",
      "from you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid his hand on my head as he uttered the last words. He had spoken\r\n",
      "earnestly, mildly: his look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding\r\n",
      "his mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his wandering\r\n",
      "sheep—or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he is\r\n",
      "responsible. All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not;\r\n",
      "whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots—provided only they be\r\n",
      "sincere—have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule. I felt\r\n",
      "veneration for St. John—veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me\r\n",
      "at once to the point I had so long shunned. I was tempted to cease\r\n",
      "struggling with him—to rush down the torrent of his will into the gulf\r\n",
      "of his existence, and there lose my own. I was almost as hard beset by\r\n",
      "him now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another. I\r\n",
      "was a fool both times. To have yielded then would have been an error of\r\n",
      "principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment. So\r\n",
      "I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet\r\n",
      "medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stood motionless under my hierophant’s touch. My refusals were\r\n",
      "forgotten—my fears overcome—my wrestlings paralysed. The\r\n",
      "Impossible—_i.e._, my marriage with St. John—was fast becoming the\r\n",
      "Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep. Religion\r\n",
      "called—Angels beckoned—God commanded—life rolled together like a\r\n",
      "scroll—death’s gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that\r\n",
      "for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.\r\n",
      "The dim room was full of visions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Could you decide now?” asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in\r\n",
      "gentle tones: he drew me to him as gently. Oh, that gentleness! how far\r\n",
      "more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John’s wrath: I grew\r\n",
      "pliant as a reed under his kindness. Yet I knew all the time, if I\r\n",
      "yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my\r\n",
      "former rebellion. His nature was not changed by one hour of solemn\r\n",
      "prayer: it was only elevated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could decide if I were but certain,” I answered: “were I but\r\n",
      "convinced that it is God’s will I should marry you, I could vow to\r\n",
      "marry you here and now—come afterwards what would!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My prayers are heard!” ejaculated St. John. He pressed his hand firmer\r\n",
      "on my head, as if he claimed me: he surrounded me with his arm,\r\n",
      "_almost_ as if he loved me (I say _almost_—I knew the difference—for I\r\n",
      "had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him, I had now put love out\r\n",
      "of the question, and thought only of duty). I contended with my inward\r\n",
      "dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply,\r\n",
      "fervently longed to do what was right; and only that. “Show me, show me\r\n",
      "the path!” I entreated of Heaven. I was excited more than I had ever\r\n",
      "been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader\r\n",
      "shall judge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself,\r\n",
      "were now retired to rest. The one candle was dying out: the room was\r\n",
      "full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.\r\n",
      "Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it\r\n",
      "through, and passed at once to my head and extremities. The feeling was\r\n",
      "not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as\r\n",
      "startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto\r\n",
      "had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to\r\n",
      "wake. They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered\r\n",
      "on my bones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What have you heard? What do you see?” asked St. John. I saw nothing,\r\n",
      "but I heard a voice somewhere cry—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane! Jane! Jane!”—nothing more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“O God! what is it?” I gasped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I might have said, “Where is it?” for it did not seem in the room—nor\r\n",
      "in the house—nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air—nor from\r\n",
      "under the earth—nor from overhead. I had heard it—where, or whence, for\r\n",
      "ever impossible to know! And it was the voice of a human being—a known,\r\n",
      "loved, well-remembered voice—that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it\r\n",
      "spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am coming!” I cried. “Wait for me! Oh, I will come!” I flew to the\r\n",
      "door and looked into the passage: it was dark. I ran out into the\r\n",
      "garden: it was void.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are you?” I exclaimed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back—“Where are\r\n",
      "you?” I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland\r\n",
      "loneliness and midnight hush.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Down superstition!” I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the\r\n",
      "black yew at the gate. “This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft:\r\n",
      "it is the work of nature. She was roused, and did—no miracle—but her\r\n",
      "best.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me. It\r\n",
      "was _my_ time to assume ascendency. _My_ powers were in play and in\r\n",
      "force. I told him to forbear question or remark; I desired him to leave\r\n",
      "me: I must and would be alone. He obeyed at once. Where there is energy\r\n",
      "to command well enough, obedience never fails. I mounted to my chamber;\r\n",
      "locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way—a different\r\n",
      "way to St. John’s, but effective in its own fashion. I seemed to\r\n",
      "penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in\r\n",
      "gratitude at His feet. I rose from the thanksgiving—took a resolve—and\r\n",
      "lay down, unscared, enlightened—eager but for the daylight.\r\n",

      "The daylight came. I rose at dawn. I busied myself for an hour or two\r\n",
      "with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the\r\n",
      "order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.\r\n",
      "Meantime, I heard St. John quit his room. He stopped at my door: I\r\n",
      "feared he would knock—no, but a slip of paper was passed under the\r\n",
      "door. I took it up. It bore these words—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You left me too suddenly last night. Had you stayed but a little\r\n",
      "longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian’s cross and the\r\n",
      "angel’s crown. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this\r\n",
      "day fortnight. Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into\r\n",
      "temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is\r\n",
      "weak. I shall pray for you hourly.—Yours, ST. JOHN.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My spirit,” I answered mentally, “is willing to do what is right; and\r\n",
      "my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven,\r\n",
      "when once that will is distinctly known to me. At any rate, it shall be\r\n",
      "strong enough to search—inquire—to grope an outlet from this cloud of\r\n",
      "doubt, and find the open day of certainty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain\r\n",
      "beat fast on my casement. I heard the front-door open, and St. John\r\n",
      "pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him traverse the garden. He\r\n",
      "took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross—there\r\n",
      "he would meet the coach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time. I filled the interval in\r\n",
      "walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had\r\n",
      "given my plans their present bent. I recalled that inward sensation I\r\n",
      "had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable\r\n",
      "strangeness. I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned\r\n",
      "whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in _me_—not in the\r\n",
      "external world. I asked was it a mere nervous impression—a delusion? I\r\n",
      "could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. The\r\n",
      "wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the\r\n",
      "foundations of Paul and Silas’s prison; it had opened the doors of the\r\n",
      "soul’s cell and loosed its bands—it had wakened it out of its sleep,\r\n",
      "whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a\r\n",
      "cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit,\r\n",
      "which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the\r\n",
      "success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of\r\n",
      "the cumbrous body.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ere many days,” I said, as I terminated my musings, “I will know\r\n",
      "something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me. Letters\r\n",
      "have proved of no avail—personal inquiry shall replace them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey,\r\n",
      "and should be absent at least four days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alone, Jane?” they asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some\r\n",
      "time been uneasy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had\r\n",
      "believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had\r\n",
      "often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained\r\n",
      "from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well\r\n",
      "enough to travel. I looked very pale, she observed. I replied, that\r\n",
      "nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no\r\n",
      "inquiries—no surmises. Having once explained to them that I could not\r\n",
      "now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in\r\n",
      "the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of\r\n",
      "free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I left Moor House at three o’clock P.M., and soon after four I stood at\r\n",
      "the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the\r\n",
      "coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield. Amidst the silence of\r\n",
      "those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great\r\n",
      "distance. It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted\r\n",
      "one summer evening on this very spot—how desolate, and hopeless, and\r\n",
      "objectless! It stopped as I beckoned. I entered—not now obliged to part\r\n",
      "with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation. Once more on\r\n",
      "the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours. I had set out from Whitcross\r\n",
      "on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning\r\n",
      "the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the\r\n",
      "midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral\r\n",
      "hills (how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern\r\n",
      "North-Midland moors of Morton!) met my eye like the lineaments of a\r\n",
      "once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was\r\n",
      "sure we were near my bourne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How far is Thornfield Hall from here?” I asked of the ostler.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just two miles, ma’am, across the fields.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My journey is closed,” I thought to myself. I got out of the coach,\r\n",
      "gave a box I had into the ostler’s charge, to be kept till I called for\r\n",
      "it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the\r\n",
      "brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt\r\n",
      "letters, “The Rochester Arms.” My heart leapt up: I was already on my\r\n",
      "master’s very lands. It fell again: the thought struck it:—\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you\r\n",
      "know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten,\r\n",
      "who besides him is there? His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do\r\n",
      "with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence. You have lost\r\n",
      "your labour—you had better go no farther,” urged the monitor. “Ask\r\n",
      "information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek:\r\n",
      "they can solve your doubts at once. Go up to that man, and inquire if\r\n",
      "Mr. Rochester be at home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on\r\n",
      "it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair. To prolong\r\n",
      "doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the\r\n",
      "ray of her star. There was the stile before me—the very fields through\r\n",
      "which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury\r\n",
      "tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere I\r\n",
      "well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of\r\n",
      "them. How fast I walked! How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to\r\n",
      "catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I\r\n",
      "welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill\r\n",
      "between them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke\r\n",
      "the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.\r\n",
      "Another field crossed—a lane threaded—and there were the courtyard\r\n",
      "walls—the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. “My\r\n",
      "first view of it shall be in front,” I determined, “where its bold\r\n",
      "battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single\r\n",
      "out my master’s very window: perhaps he will be standing at it—he rises\r\n",
      "early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in\r\n",
      "front. Could I but see him!—but a moment! Surely, in that case, I\r\n",
      "should not be so mad as to run to him? I cannot tell—I am not certain.\r\n",
      "And if I did—what then? God bless him! What then? Who would be hurt by\r\n",
      "my once more tasting the life his glance can give me? I rave: perhaps\r\n",
      "at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the\r\n",
      "tideless sea of the south.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard—turned its angle:\r\n",
      "there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone\r\n",
      "pillars crowned by stone balls. From behind one pillar I could peep\r\n",
      "round quietly at the full front of the mansion. I advanced my head with\r\n",
      "precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet\r\n",
      "drawn up: battlements, windows, long front—all from this sheltered\r\n",
      "station were at my command.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.\r\n",
      "I wonder what they thought. They must have considered I was very\r\n",
      "careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and\r\n",
      "reckless. A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my\r\n",
      "niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in\r\n",
      "front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.\r\n",
      "“What affectation of diffidence was this at first?” they might have\r\n",
      "demanded; “what stupid regardlessness now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hear an illustration, reader.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A lover finds his mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he wishes to catch a\r\n",
      "glimpse of her fair face without waking her. He steals softly over the\r\n",
      "grass, careful to make no sound; he pauses—fancying she has stirred: he\r\n",
      "withdraws: not for worlds would he be seen. All is still: he again\r\n",
      "advances: he bends above her; a light veil rests on her features: he\r\n",
      "lifts it, bends lower; now his eyes anticipate the vision of\r\n",
      "beauty—warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest. How hurried was their\r\n",
      "first glance! But how they fix! How he starts! How he suddenly and\r\n",
      "vehemently clasps in both arms the form he dared not, a moment since,\r\n",
      "touch with his finger! How he calls aloud a name, and drops his burden,\r\n",
      "and gazes on it wildly! He thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he\r\n",
      "no longer fears to waken by any sound he can utter—by any movement he\r\n",
      "can make. He thought his love slept sweetly: he finds she is stone\r\n",
      "dead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened\r\n",
      "ruin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!—to peep up at chamber\r\n",
      "lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for\r\n",
      "doors opening—to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk! The\r\n",
      "lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. The\r\n",
      "front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a shell-like wall,\r\n",
      "very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows:\r\n",
      "no roof, no battlements, no chimneys—all had crashed in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there was the silence of death about it: the solitude of a lonesome\r\n",
      "wild. No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never\r\n",
      "received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church\r\n",
      "aisle. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had\r\n",
      "fallen—by conflagration: but how kindled? What story belonged to this\r\n",
      "disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had\r\n",
      "followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property? If so,\r\n",
      "whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it—not even\r\n",
      "dumb sign, mute token.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated\r\n",
      "interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late\r\n",
      "occurrence. Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void\r\n",
      "arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the\r\n",
      "drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and\r\n",
      "weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters. And oh!\r\n",
      "where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck? In what land? Under\r\n",
      "what auspices? My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower\r\n",
      "near the gates, and I asked, “Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing\r\n",
      "the shelter of his narrow marble house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but\r\n",
      "at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned. The host himself brought\r\n",
      "my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him to shut the door and sit\r\n",
      "down: I had some questions to ask him. But when he complied, I scarcely\r\n",
      "knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet\r\n",
      "the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure\r\n",
      "for a tale of misery. The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged\r\n",
      "man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You know Thornfield Hall, of course?” I managed to say at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am; I lived there once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you?” Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was the late Mr. Rochester’s butler,” he added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been\r\n",
      "trying to evade.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The late!” I gasped. “Is he dead?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward’s father,” he explained. I\r\n",
      "breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. Fully assured by these words\r\n",
      "that Mr. Edward—_my_ Mr. Rochester (God bless him, wherever he\r\n",
      "was!)—was at least alive: was, in short, “the present gentleman.”\r\n",
      "Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come—whatever\r\n",
      "the disclosures might be—with comparative tranquillity. Since he was\r\n",
      "not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he was at the\r\n",
      "Antipodes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?” I asked, knowing, of\r\n",
      "course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the\r\n",
      "direct question as to where he really was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, ma’am—oh, no! No one is living there. I suppose you are a stranger\r\n",
      "in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last\r\n",
      "autumn,—Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about\r\n",
      "harvest-time. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable\r\n",
      "property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved. The\r\n",
      "fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from\r\n",
      "Millcote, the building was one mass of flame. It was a terrible\r\n",
      "spectacle: I witnessed it myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At dead of night!” I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality\r\n",
      "at Thornfield. “Was it known how it originated?” I demanded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They guessed, ma’am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was\r\n",
      "ascertained beyond a doubt. You are not perhaps aware,” he continued,\r\n",
      "edging his chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, “that\r\n",
      "there was a lady—a—a lunatic, kept in the house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard something of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She was kept in very close confinement, ma’am; people even for some\r\n",
      "years was not absolutely certain of her existence. No one saw her: they\r\n",
      "only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what\r\n",
      "she was it was difficult to conjecture. They said Mr. Edward had\r\n",
      "brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.\r\n",
      "But a queer thing happened a year since—a very queer thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him to the\r\n",
      "main fact.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this lady?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This lady, ma’am,” he answered, “turned out to be Mr. Rochester’s\r\n",
      "wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way. There was a\r\n",
      "young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the fire,” I suggested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m coming to that, ma’am—that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The\r\n",
      "servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was\r\n",
      "after her continually. They used to watch him—servants will, you know,\r\n",
      "ma’am—and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him\r\n",
      "thought her so very handsome. She was a little small thing, they say,\r\n",
      "almost like a child. I never saw her myself; but I’ve heard Leah, the\r\n",
      "house-maid, tell of her. Leah liked her well enough. Mr. Rochester was\r\n",
      "about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen\r\n",
      "of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were\r\n",
      "bewitched. Well, he would marry her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shall tell me this part of the story another time,” I said; “but\r\n",
      "now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.\r\n",
      "Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in\r\n",
      "it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve hit it, ma’am: it’s quite certain that it was her, and nobody\r\n",
      "but her, that set it going. She had a woman to take care of her called\r\n",
      "Mrs. Poole—an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one\r\n",
      "fault—a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons—_she kept a\r\n",
      "private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.\r\n",
      "It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was\r\n",
      "dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water,\r\n",
      "the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of\r\n",
      "her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the\r\n",
      "house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head. They say she\r\n",
      "had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don’t know about\r\n",
      "that. However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the\r\n",
      "room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made\r\n",
      "her way to the chamber that had been the governess’s—(she was like as\r\n",
      "if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at\r\n",
      "her)—and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in\r\n",
      "it, fortunately. The governess had run away two months before; and for\r\n",
      "all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing\r\n",
      "he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew\r\n",
      "savage—quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but\r\n",
      "he got dangerous after he lost her. He would be alone, too. He sent\r\n",
      "Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but\r\n",
      "he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and\r\n",
      "she deserved it—she was a very good woman. Miss Adèle, a ward he had,\r\n",
      "was put to school. He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and\r\n",
      "shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! did he not leave England?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Leave England? Bless you, no! He would not cross the door-stones of\r\n",
      "the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the\r\n",
      "grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses—which it is my\r\n",
      "opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he\r\n",
      "was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma’am.\r\n",
      "He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and\r\n",
      "he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his\r\n",
      "own, if ever man had. I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part,\r\n",
      "I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she\r\n",
      "came to Thornfield Hall.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning\r\n",
      "above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them\r\n",
      "down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell. And\r\n",
      "then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was\r\n",
      "standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till\r\n",
      "they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own\r\n",
      "eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it\r\n",
      "streaming against the flames as she stood. I witnessed, and several\r\n",
      "more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the\r\n",
      "roof; we heard him call ‘Bertha!’ We saw him approach her; and then,\r\n",
      "ma’am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay\r\n",
      "smashed on the pavement.”\r\n",

      "“And afterwards?” I urged.\r\n",

      "Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great\r\n",
      "crash—all fell. He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly\r\n",
      "hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one\r\n",
      "eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the\r\n",
      "surgeon, had to amputate it directly. The other eye inflamed: he lost\r\n",

      "CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The manor-house of Ferndean was a building of considerable antiquity,\r\n",
      "moderate size, and no architectural pretensions, deep buried in a wood.\r\n",
      "I had heard of it before. Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and\r\n",
      "sometimes went there. His father had purchased the estate for the sake\r\n",
      "of the game covers. He would have let the house, but could find no\r\n",
      "tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site.\r\n",
      "Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception\r\n",
      "of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the\r\n",
      "squire when he went there in the season to shoot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the\r\n",
      "characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating\r\n",
      "rain. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise\r\n",
      "and driver with the double remuneration I had promised. Even when\r\n",
      "within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing\r\n",
      "of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.\r\n",
      "Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and\r\n",
      "passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of\r\n",
      "close-ranked trees. There was a grass-grown track descending the forest\r\n",
      "aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I\r\n",
      "followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on\r\n",
      "and on, it wound far and farther: no sign of habitation or grounds was\r\n",
      "visible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness\r\n",
      "of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me. I looked round\r\n",
      "in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem,\r\n",
      "columnar trunk, dense summer foliage—no opening anywhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little;\r\n",
      "presently I beheld a railing, then the house—scarce, by this dim light,\r\n",
      "distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying\r\n",
      "walls. Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a\r\n",
      "space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a\r\n",
      "semicircle. There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad\r\n",
      "gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of\r\n",
      "the forest. The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the\r\n",
      "windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one\r\n",
      "step led up to it. The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms\r\n",
      "had said, “quite a desolate spot.” It was as still as a church on a\r\n",
      "week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound\r\n",
      "audible in its vicinage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can there be life here?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement—that narrow\r\n",
      "front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the\r\n",
      "grange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the\r\n",
      "step; a man without a hat: he stretched forth his hand as if to feel\r\n",
      "whether it rained. Dusk as it was, I had recognised him—it was my\r\n",
      "master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him—to examine\r\n",
      "him, myself unseen, and alas! to him invisible. It was a sudden\r\n",
      "meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had\r\n",
      "no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from\r\n",
      "hasty advance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his port\r\n",
      "was still erect, his hair was still raven black; nor were his features\r\n",
      "altered or sunk: not in one year’s space, by any sorrow, could his\r\n",
      "athletic strength be quelled or his vigorous prime blighted. But in his\r\n",
      "countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding—that\r\n",
      "reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous\r\n",
      "to approach in his sullen woe. The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes\r\n",
      "cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, reader, do you think I feared him in his blind ferocity?—if you\r\n",
      "do, you little know me. A soft hope blent with my sorrow that soon I\r\n",
      "should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so\r\n",
      "sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet. I would not accost him yet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards\r\n",
      "the grass-plat. Where was his daring stride now? Then he paused, as if\r\n",
      "he knew not which way to turn. He lifted his hand and opened his\r\n",
      "eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and\r\n",
      "toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him was void\r\n",
      "darkness. He stretched his right hand (the left arm, the mutilated one,\r\n",
      "he kept hidden in his bosom); he seemed to wish by touch to gain an\r\n",
      "idea of what lay around him: he met but vacancy still; for the trees\r\n",
      "were some yards off where he stood. He relinquished the endeavour,\r\n",
      "folded his arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast\r\n",
      "on his uncovered head. At this moment John approached him from some\r\n",
      "quarter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you take my arm, sir?” he said; “there is a heavy shower coming\r\n",
      "on: had you not better go in?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me alone,” was the answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to\r\n",
      "walk about: vainly,—all was too uncertain. He groped his way back to\r\n",
      "the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now drew near and knocked: John’s wife opened for me. “Mary,” I said,\r\n",
      "“how are you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She started as if she had seen a ghost: I calmed her. To her hurried\r\n",
      "“Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?”\r\n",
      "I answered by taking her hand; and then I followed her into the\r\n",
      "kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire. I explained to them, in few\r\n",
      "words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield,\r\n",
      "and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester. I asked John to go down to\r\n",
      "the turn-pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my\r\n",
      "trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and\r\n",
      "shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the\r\n",
      "Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that\r\n",
      "effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her I\r\n",
      "should stay. Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When you go in,” said I, “tell your master that a person wishes to\r\n",
      "speak to him, but do not give my name.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t think he will see you,” she answered; “he refuses everybody.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When she returned, I inquired what he had said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are to send in your name and your business,” she replied. She then\r\n",
      "proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together\r\n",
      "with candles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that what he rang for?” I asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I took it from her hand: she pointed me out the parlour door. The tray\r\n",
      "shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my\r\n",
      "ribs loud and fast. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in\r\n",
      "the grate; and, leaning over it, with his head supported against the\r\n",
      "high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.\r\n",
      "His old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled\r\n",
      "up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon. Pilot pricked up\r\n",
      "his ears when I came in: then he jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and\r\n",
      "bounded towards me: he almost knocked the tray from my hands. I set it\r\n",
      "on the table; then patted him, and said softly, “Lie down!” Mr.\r\n",
      "Rochester turned mechanically to _see_ what the commotion was: but as\r\n",
      "he _saw_ nothing, he returned and sighed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me the water, Mary,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I approached him with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed\r\n",
      "me, still excited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter?” he inquired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Down, Pilot!” I again said. He checked the water on its way to his\r\n",
      "lips, and seemed to listen: he drank, and put the glass down. “This is\r\n",
      "you, Mary, is it not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mary is in the kitchen,” I answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put out his hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood,\r\n",
      "he did not touch me. “Who is this? Who is this?” he demanded, trying,\r\n",
      "as it seemed, to _see_ with those sightless eyes—unavailing and\r\n",
      "distressing attempt! “Answer me—speak again!” he ordered, imperiously\r\n",
      "and aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in\r\n",
      "the glass,” I said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_Who_ is it? _What_ is it? Who speaks?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this\r\n",
      "evening,” I answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Great God!—what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has\r\n",
      "seized me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No delusion—no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion,\r\n",
      "your health too sound for frenzy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I _cannot_ see, but\r\n",
      "I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst. Whatever—whoever\r\n",
      "you are—be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He groped; I arrested his wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her very fingers!” he cried; “her small, slight fingers! If so there\r\n",
      "must be more of her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The muscular hand broke from my custody; my arm was seized, my\r\n",
      "shoulder—neck—waist—I was entwined and gathered to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it Jane? _What_ is it? This is her shape—this is her size—”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this her voice,” I added. “She is all here: her heart, too. God\r\n",
      "bless you, sir! I am glad to be so near you again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane Eyre!—Jane Eyre,” was all he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear master,” I answered, “I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out—I\r\n",
      "am come back to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In truth?—in the flesh? My living Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You touch me, sir,—you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a\r\n",
      "corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My living darling! These are certainly her limbs, and these her\r\n",
      "features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery. It is a dream;\r\n",
      "such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to\r\n",
      "my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus—and felt that she loved\r\n",
      "me, and trusted that she would not leave me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which I never will, sir, from this day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never will, says the vision? But I always woke and found it an empty\r\n",
      "mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned—my life dark, lonely,\r\n",
      "hopeless—my soul athirst and forbidden to drink—my heart famished and\r\n",
      "never to be fed. Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will\r\n",
      "fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before\r\n",
      "you go—embrace me, Jane.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There, sir—and there!”’\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I pressed my lips to his once brilliant and now rayless eyes—I swept\r\n",
      "his hair from his brow, and kissed that too. He suddenly seemed to\r\n",
      "arouse himself: the conviction of the reality of all this seized him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is you—is it, Jane? You are come back to me then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream? And you are\r\n",
      "not a pining outcast amongst strangers?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, sir! I am an independent woman now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Independent! What do you mean, Jane?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah! this is practical—this is real!” he cried: “I should never dream\r\n",
      "that. Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and\r\n",
      "piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life\r\n",
      "into it.—What, Janet! Are you an independent woman? A rich woman?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite rich, sir. If you won’t let me live with you, I can build a\r\n",
      "house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my\r\n",
      "parlour when you want company of an evening.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will\r\n",
      "look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind\r\n",
      "lameter like me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own\r\n",
      "mistress.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you will stay with me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly—unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse,\r\n",
      "your housekeeper. I find you lonely: I will be your companion—to read\r\n",
      "to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes\r\n",
      "and hands to you. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you\r\n",
      "shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He replied not: he seemed serious—abstracted; he sighed; he half-opened\r\n",
      "his lips as if to speak: he closed them again. I felt a little\r\n",
      "embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities;\r\n",
      "and he, like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness. I had\r\n",
      "indeed made my proposal from the idea that he wished and would ask me\r\n",
      "to be his wife: an expectation, not the less certain because\r\n",
      "unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he would claim me at once as his\r\n",
      "own. But no hint to that effect escaping him and his countenance\r\n",
      "becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been\r\n",
      "all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began\r\n",
      "gently to withdraw myself from his arms—but he eagerly snatched me\r\n",
      "closer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No—no—Jane; you must not go. No—I have touched you, heard you, felt\r\n",
      "the comfort of your presence—the sweetness of your consolation: I\r\n",
      "cannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself—I must have\r\n",
      "you. The world may laugh—may call me absurd, selfish—but it does not\r\n",
      "signify. My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will\r\n",
      "take deadly vengeance on its frame.”\r\n",

      "Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps\r\n",
      "it was that circumstance that drew us so very near—that knit us so very\r\n",
      "close: for I was then his vision, as I am still his right hand.\r\n",
      "Literally, I was (what he often called me) the apple of his eye. He saw\r\n",
      "nature—he saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his\r\n",
      "behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town,\r\n",
      "river, cloud, sunbeam—of the landscape before us; of the weather round\r\n",
      "us—and impressing by sound on his ear what light could no longer stamp\r\n",
      "on his eye. Never did I weary of reading to him; never did I weary of\r\n",
      "conducting him where he wished to go: of doing for him what he wished\r\n",
      "to be done. And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most\r\n",
      "exquisite, even though sad—because he claimed these services without\r\n",
      "painful shame or damping humiliation. He loved me so truly, that he\r\n",
      "knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he felt I loved him\r\n",
      "so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest\r\n",
      "wishes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to\r\n",
      "his dictation, he came and bent over me, and said—“Jane, have you a\r\n",
      "glittering ornament round your neck?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had a gold watch-chain: I answered “Yes.”\r\n",

      "obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he was\r\n",
      "sure of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He and I went up to London. He had the advice of an eminent oculist;\r\n",
      "and he eventually recovered the sight of that one eye. He cannot now\r\n",
      "see very distinctly: he cannot read or write much; but he can find his\r\n",
      "way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to\r\n",
      "him—the earth no longer a void. When his first-born was put into his\r\n",
      "arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes, as they\r\n",
      "once were—large, brilliant, and black. On that occasion, he again, with\r\n",
      "a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.\r\n",

      "alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see\r\n",
      "them. Diana’s husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a\r\n",
      "good man. Mary’s is a clergyman, a college friend of her brother’s,\r\n",
      "and, from his attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.\r\n",

      "resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.\r\n",
      "Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he\r\n",
      "labours for his race; he clears their painful way to improvement; he\r\n",
      "hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber\r\n",
      "it. He may be stern; he may be exacting; he may be ambitious yet; but\r\n",

      "after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.”\r\n",

      "way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it\r\n",

      "attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all\r\n",
      "_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\r\n",
      "very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\r\n",
      "encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\r\n",

      "every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\r\n",
      "therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\r\n",

      "leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if\r\n",

      "chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a\r\n",

      "the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or\r\n",
      "ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the\r\n",

      "thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\r\n",
      "in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\r\n",
      "fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\r\n",
      "the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\r\n",

      "to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\r\n",
      "Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\r\n",
      "their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\r\n",
      "better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\r\n",
      "hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\r\n",
      "news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\r\n",
      "some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\r\n",
      "with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\r\n",

      "and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\r\n",
      "visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\r\n",
      "unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\r\n",
      "indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\r\n",

      "advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\r\n",

      "engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\r\n",
      "Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\r\n",
      "eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\r\n",
      "dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\r\n",
      "began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\r\n",
      "pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\r\n",
      "she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\r\n",
      "thought the same, and added,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\r\n",
      "walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\r\n",
      "looked almost wild.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\r\n",
      "nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\r\n",
      "country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\r\n",
      "in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\r\n",
      "hide it not doing its office.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\r\n",
      "all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\r\n",
      "when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\r\n",
      "escaped my notice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\r\n",
      "inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\r\n",
      "an exhibition.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\r\n",
      "above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\r\n",
      "it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\r\n",
      "a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\r\n",
      "Bingley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\r\n",
      "“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\r\n",
      "eyes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\r\n",
      "short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\r\n",
      "girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\r\n",
      "a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\r\n",
      "chance of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\r\n",
      "Meryton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it\r\n",
      "would not make them one jot less agreeable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\r\n",
      "consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\r\n",
      "hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\r\n",
      "their dear friend’s vulgar relations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on\r\n",
      "leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.\r\n",
      "She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till\r\n",
      "late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and\r\n",
      "when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go\r\n",
      "down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\r\n",
      "party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\r\n",
      "them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\r\n",
      "excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\r\n",
      "below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great\r\n",
      "reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I\r\n",
      "am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and\r\n",
      "I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\r\n",
      "where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\r\n",
      "others; all that his library afforded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\r\n",
      "credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\r\n",
      "than I ever looked into.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\r\n",
      "in the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left\r\n",
      "so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\r\n",
      "Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many\r\n",
      "generations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\r\n",
      "books.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\r\n",
      "these.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\r\n",
      "that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\r\n",
      "half as delightful as Pemberley.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish it may.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\r\n",
      "neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\r\n",
      "finer county in England than Derbyshire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\r\n",
      "Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\r\n",
      "attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\r\n",
      "the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\r\n",
      "sister, to observe the game.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\r\n",
      "she be as tall as I am?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or\r\n",
      "rather taller.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\r\n",
      "so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\r\n",
      "for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience\r\n",
      "to be so very accomplished as they all are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\r\n",
      "net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\r\n",
      "sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\r\n",
      "being informed that she was very accomplished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has\r\n",
      "too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\r\n",
      "otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\r\n",
      "far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\r\n",
      "cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\r\n",
      "acquaintance that are really accomplished.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\r\n",
      "idea of an accomplished woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\r\n",
      "esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\r\n",
      "with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\r\n",
      "dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\r\n",
      "this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\r\n",
      "walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\r\n",
      "will be but half deserved.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\r\n",
      "something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\r\n",
      "reading.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\r\n",
      "I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\r\n",
      "this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\r\n",
      "application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\r\n",
      "implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\r\n",
      "answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\r\n",
      "bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\r\n",
      "conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is\r\n",
      "one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\r\n",
      "sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\r\n",
      "succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\r\n",
      "“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\r\n",
      "to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\r\n",
      "despicable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\r\n",
      "continue the subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\r\n",
      "that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for\r\n",
      "immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\r\n",
      "be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\r\n",
      "eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\r\n",
      "unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled\r\n",
      "that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\r\n",
      "were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\r\n",
      "declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\r\n",
      "however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\r\n",
      "his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\r\n",
      "possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.\r\n",

      "Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the\r\n",
      "morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the\r\n",
      "inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,\r\n",
      "and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his\r\n",
      "sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a\r\n",
      "note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her\r\n",
      "own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and\r\n",
      "its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her\r\n",
      "two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been\r\n",
      "very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was\r\n",
      "not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her\r\n",
      "restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She\r\n",
      "would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried\r\n",
      "home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think\r\n",
      "it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all\r\n",
      "attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes\r\n",
      "that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be\r\n",
      "moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass\r\n",
      "a little longer on your kindness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am\r\n",
      "sure, will not hear of her removal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,\r\n",
      "“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she\r\n",
      "remains with us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not\r\n",
      "know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a\r\n",
      "vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is\r\n",
      "always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest\r\n",
      "temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to\r\n",
      "_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect\r\n",
      "over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is\r\n",
      "equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I\r\n",
      "hope, though you have but a short lease.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I\r\n",
      "should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five\r\n",
      "minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen\r\n",
      "through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\r\n",
      "intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in\r\n",
      "the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were\r\n",
      "a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\r\n",
      "least that advantage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for\r\n",
      "such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and\r\n",
      "unvarying society.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be\r\n",
      "observed in them for ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a\r\n",
      "country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_\r\n",
      "going on in the country as in town.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,\r\n",
      "turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\r\n",
      "victory over him, continued her triumph,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\r\n",
      "my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\r\n",
      "pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and\r\n",
      "when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\r\n",
      "advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\r\n",
      "gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing\r\n",
      "at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her\r\n",
      "mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\r\n",
      "such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\r\n",
      "you must acknowledge to be true.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with\r\n",
      "many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few\r\n",
      "neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his\r\n",
      "countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of\r\n",
      "saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if\r\n",
      "Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir\r\n",
      "William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so\r\n",
      "genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_\r\n",
      "is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very\r\n",
      "important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\r\n",
      "her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\r\n",
      "each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\r\n",
      "youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\r\n",

      "animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\r\n",
      "attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her\r\n",
      "own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\r\n",
      "very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\r\n",
      "ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\r\n",
      "the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\r\n",
      "to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.\r\n",

      "stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\r\n",
      "that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\r\n",
      "the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\r\n",
      "one argument in favour of its propriety.”\r\n",

      "one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\r\n",
      "supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\r\n",
      "circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\r\n",
      "thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\r\n",
      "where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\r\n",
      "very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\r\n",
      "with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\r\n",
      "with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\r\n",
      "appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\r\n",
      "between the parties?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not\r\n",
      "forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\r\n",
      "weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\r\n",
      "you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\r\n",
      "myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\r\n",
      "know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\r\n",
      "particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\r\n",
      "when he has nothing to do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\r\n",
      "rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\r\n",
      "resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\r\n",
      "brother for talking such nonsense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,\r\n",
      "and want to silence this.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\r\n",
      "thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.\r\n",

      "for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to\r\n",
      "the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the\r\n",
      "way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she\r\n",
      "seated herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books\r\n",
      "that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed\r\n",
      "on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of\r\n",
      "admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because\r\n",
      "he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,\r\n",
      "at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her\r\n",
      "more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in\r\n",
      "any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked\r\n",
      "him too little to care for his approbation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a\r\n",
      "lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near\r\n",

      "opportunity of dancing a reel?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately\r\n",
      "determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’\r\n",
      "that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always\r\n",
      "delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of\r\n",
      "their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell\r\n",
      "you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his\r\n",
      "gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her\r\n",
      "manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had\r\n",
      "never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really\r\n",

      "should be in some danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and\r\n",
      "seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,\r\n",
      "where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of\r\n",
      "pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were\r\n",
      "during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers\r\n",
      "of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment\r\n",
      "with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their\r\n",
      "acquaintance with spirit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had\r\n",
      "something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed\r\n",
      "himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst\r\n",
      "also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness\r\n",
      "and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and\r\n",
      "attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she\r\n",
      "should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,\r\n",
      "to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the\r\n",
      "door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great\r\n",
      "delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the\r\n",
      "card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open\r\n",
      "petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the\r\n",
      "silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.\r\n",
      "Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the\r\n",
      "sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and\r\n",
      "rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was\r\n",
      "perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She\r\n",
      "could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\r\n",
      "question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\r\n",
      "amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\r\n",
      "second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it\r\n",
      "is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\r\n",
      "enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\r\n",
      "book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\r\n",
      "an excellent library.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\r\n",
      "cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\r\n",
      "her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\r\n",
      "towards him and said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\r\n",
      "Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\r\n",
      "the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\r\n",
      "some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\r\n",
      "pleasure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he\r\n",
      "chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\r\n",
      "thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\r\n",
      "round my cards.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were\r\n",
      "carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\r\n",
      "tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\r\n",
      "more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\r\n",
      "day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\r\n",
      "near so much like a ball.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\r\n",
      "the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\r\n",
      "whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\r\n",
      "desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\r\n",
      "turning to Elizabeth, said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\r\n",

      "long in one attitude.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\r\n",
      "succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\r\n",
      "up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\r\n",
      "Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\r\n",
      "directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\r\n",
      "he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\r\n",
      "the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\r\n",
      "interfere. What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his\r\n",
      "meaning--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be\r\n",
      "severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask\r\n",
      "nothing about it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in\r\n",
      "anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his\r\n",
      "two motives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon\r\n",
      "as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing\r\n",
      "the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret\r\n",
      "affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures\r\n",
      "appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be\r\n",
      "completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better\r\n",
      "as I sit by the fire.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so\r\n",
      "abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We\r\n",
      "can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate\r\n",
      "as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\r\n",
      "yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,\r\n",
      "no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose\r\n",
      "ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy may hug himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an\r\n",
      "uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would\r\n",
      "be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a\r\n",

      "be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\r\n",
      "joke.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am\r\n",
      "not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies\r\n",
      "and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I\r\n",
      "laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what\r\n",
      "you are without.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of\r\n",
      "my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\r\n",
      "understanding to ridicule.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Such as vanity and pride.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;\r\n",
      "“and pray what is the result?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\r\n",
      "himself without disguise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\r\n",
      "but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\r\n",
      "for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\r\n",
      "convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\r\n",
      "others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\r\n",
      "feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\r\n",
      "would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\r\n",
      "ever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment\r\n",
      "_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\r\n",
      "really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\r\n",
      "evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”\r\n",

      "“And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.”\r\n",

      "she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at\r\n",
      "length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\r\n",
      "that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\r\n",

      "of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\r\n",
      "soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\r\n",

      "wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\r\n",
      "should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\r\n",
      "influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\r\n",
      "suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\r\n",
      "in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\r\n",
      "ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\r\n",
      "one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\r\n",
      "conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\r\n",
      "all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last\r\n",

      "after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\r\n",
      "see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\r\n",

      "they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking\r\n",
      "with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very\r\n",
      "Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and\r\n",
      "he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all\r\n",
      "wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible\r\n",
      "to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting\r\n",
      "something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the\r\n",
      "pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same\r\n",
      "spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\r\n",
      "introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\r\n",
      "before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\r\n",
      "their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\r\n",
      "only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\r\n",
      "greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\r\n",
      "countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\r\n",
      "was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\r\n",
      "readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\r\n",
      "whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\r\n",
      "when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\r\n",
      "seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\r\n",
      "the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\r\n",
      "civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\r\n",
      "principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\r\n",
      "purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\r\n",
      "was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\r\n",
      "were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\r\n",
      "happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\r\n",
      "was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\r\n",
      "one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\r\n",
      "touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\r\n",
      "What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\r\n",
      "impossible not to long to know.\r\n",

      "Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of\r\n",

      "Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from\r\n",
      "their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly\r\n",
      "expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own\r\n",
      "carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if\r\n",
      "she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had\r\n",
      "told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,\r\n",
      "because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with\r\n",
      "her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\r\n",
      "apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\r\n",
      "her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\r\n",
      "justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\r\n",
      "her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\r\n",
      "breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\r\n",
      "by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\r\n",
      "could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\r\n",
      "brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s\r\n",
      "commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\r\n",
      "she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\r\n",
      "appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\r\n",
      "but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\r\n",
      "officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,\r\n",
      "disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\r\n",
      "next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\r\n",
      "would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\r\n",
      "protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\r\n",
      "tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\r\n",
      "delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\r\n",

      "utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be\r\n",

      "yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\r\n",
      "attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\r\n",
      "Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\r\n",

      "A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\r\n",
      "now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\r\n",
      "give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\r\n",
      "intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\r\n",
      "conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\r\n",
      "to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\r\n",
      "Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\r\n",
      "was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\r\n",
      "less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\r\n",
      "anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\r\n",
      "may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\r\n",
      "freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\r\n",

      "less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\r\n",
      "attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\r\n",

      "intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\r\n",
      "be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;\r\n",
      "and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\r\n",
      "freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\r\n",
      "poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\r\n",

      "degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\r\n",
      "Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\r\n",
      "which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\r\n",
      "careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\r\n",
      "proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\r\n",
      "of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\r\n",
      "nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\r\n",
      "and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her\r\n",
      "home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,\r\n",
      "who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\r\n",
      "be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not\r\n",
      "want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth\r\n",
      "his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a\r\n",
      "very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride\r\n",
      "never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,\r\n",

      "The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round\r\n",
      "the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin\r\n",
      "Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were\r\n",
      "made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\r\n",
      "but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\r\n",
      "her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\r\n",
      "that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\r\n",
      "make herself uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a\r\n",
      "card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\r\n",
      "am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a\r\n",

      "Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\r\n",
      "her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have\r\n",
      "not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\r\n",
      "her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\r\n",

      "evil.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her\r\n",
      "hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a\r\n",
      "simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant\r\n",
      "in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no\r\n",
      "answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\r\n",
      "she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\r\n",
      "reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\r\n",
      "They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\r\n",
      "imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\r\n",
      "first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\r\n",
      "would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\r\n",
      "she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\r\n",
      "silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\r\n",
      "with--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\r\n",
      "dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\r\n",
      "room, or the number of couples.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\r\n",
      "said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\r\n",
      "may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\r\n",
      "_now_ we may be silent.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\r\n",
      "entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\r\n",
      "_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\r\n",
      "trouble of saying as little as possible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\r\n",
      "imagine that you are gratifying mine?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great\r\n",
      "similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\r\n",
      "taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\r\n",
      "something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\r\n",
      "posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”\r\n",
      "said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\r\n",
      "think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must not decide on my own performance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\r\n",
      "the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\r\n",
      "walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\r\n",
      "the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just\r\n",
      "been forming a new acquaintance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\r\n",
      "features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\r\n",
      "for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\r\n",
      "constrained manner said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\r\n",
      "_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\r\n",
      "is less certain.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\r\n",
      "his life.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\r\n",
      "that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\r\n",
      "through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\r\n",
      "his dancing and his partner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\r\n",
      "superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\r\n",
      "first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\r\n",
      "disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\r\n",
      "especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\r\n",
      "at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\r\n",
      "then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\r\n",
      "You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\r\n",

      "unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And what is your success?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary\r\n",
      "greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\r\n",
      "not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\r\n",
      "fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.\r\n",
      "She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in\r\n",
      "silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for\r\n",
      "in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,\r\n",
      "which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against\r\n",
      "another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,\r\n",
      "with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?\r\n",
      "Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand\r\n",
      "questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his\r\n",
      "other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give\r\n",
      "implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using\r\n",
      "him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always\r\n",
      "remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a\r\n",
      "most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very\r\n",
      "well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear\r\n",
      "to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he\r\n",
      "could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he\r\n",
      "was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.\r\n",
      "His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and\r\n",
      "I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this\r\n",
      "discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his\r\n",
      "descent, one could not expect much better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”\r\n",
      "said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing\r\n",
      "worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can\r\n",
      "assure you, he informed me himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.\r\n",
      "“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if\r\n",
      "you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see\r\n",
      "nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make\r\n",
      "inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of\r\n",
      "such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently\r\n",
      "marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude\r\n",
      "for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave\r\n",
      "way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her\r\n",
      "sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have\r\n",
      "been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case\r\n",
      "you may be sure of my pardon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing\r\n",
      "satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his\r\n",
      "history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have\r\n",
      "principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,\r\n",
      "the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has\r\n",
      "received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his\r\n",
      "sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am\r\n",
      "afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s\r\n",
      "regard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am\r\n",
      "perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard\r\n",
      "them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to\r\n",
      "him _conditionally_ only.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,\r\n",
      "“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but\r\n",
      "since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt\r\n",
      "the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of\r\n",
      "both gentlemen as I did before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on\r\n",
      "which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with\r\n",
      "delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of\r\n",
      "Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence\r\n",
      "in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew\r\n",
      "to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last\r\n",
      "partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,\r\n",
      "and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate\r\n",
      "as to make a most important discovery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now\r\n",
      "in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the\r\n",
      "gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of\r\n",
      "this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would\r\n",
      "have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de\r\n",
      "Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made\r\n",
      "in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,\r\n",
      "and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total\r\n",
      "ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.\r\n",
      "I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to\r\n",
      "assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him\r\n",
      "that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as\r\n",
      "an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it\r\n",
      "was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either\r\n",
      "side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in\r\n",
      "consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with\r\n",
      "the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased\r\n",
      "speaking, replied thus,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your\r\n",
      "excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your\r\n",
      "understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference\r\n",
      "between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those\r\n",
      "which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider\r\n",
      "the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank\r\n",
      "in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the\r\n",
      "same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the\r\n",
      "dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform\r\n",
      "what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by\r\n",
      "your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,\r\n",
      "though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education\r\n",
      "and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like\r\n",
      "yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose\r\n",
      "reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at\r\n",
      "being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with\r\n",
      "a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if\r\n",
      "hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”\r\n",
      "“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him\r\n",
      "expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with\r\n",
      "unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,\r\n",
      "replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\r\n",
      "discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\r\n",
      "abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the\r\n",
      "end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins then returned to Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my\r\n",
      "reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered\r\n",
      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\r\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\r\n",
      "certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very\r\n",
      "handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned\r\n",
      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\r\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\r\n",
      "her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\r\n",
      "very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could\r\n",
      "bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring\r\n",
      "even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly\r\n",
      "saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,\r\n",
      "lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,\r\n",
      "she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within\r\n",
      "one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was\r\n",
      "talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing\r\n",
      "else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.\r\n",
      "Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable\r\n",
      "of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\r\n",
      "a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\r\n",
      "were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\r\n",
      "comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\r\n",
      "certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\r\n",
      "was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\r\n",
      "Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\r\n",
      "and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\r\n",
      "consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\r\n",
      "not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\r\n",
      "to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\r\n",
      "occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She\r\n",
      "concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally\r\n",
      "fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no\r\n",
      "chance of it.\r\n",

      "whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\r\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\r\n",
      "mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.\r\n",

      "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\r\n",
      "glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what\r\n",
      "she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was\r\n",
      "convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression\r\n",
      "of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and\r\n",
      "steady gravity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no\r\n",
      "likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.\r\n",

      "tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\r\n",
      "had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\r\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\r\n",
      "entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\r\n",
      "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\r\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\r\n",
      "she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\r\n",

      "her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\r\n",
      "She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\r\n",
      "talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\r\n",
      "signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\r\n",
      "impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\r\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\r\n",
      "and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.\r\n",
      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\r\n",

      "Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\r\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\r\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\r\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\r\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\r\n",
      "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\r\n",
      "music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\r\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\r\n",
      "an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\r\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\r\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\r\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\r\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\r\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\r\n",
      "everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I\r\n",
      "cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who\r\n",
      "should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody\r\n",
      "connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded\r\n",
      "his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\r\n",
      "room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\r\n",
      "Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\r\n",
      "having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\r\n",
      "Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\r\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\r\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\r\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\r\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\r\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\r\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\r\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\r\n",
      "she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\r\n",
      "the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he\r\n",
      "could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her\r\n",
      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\r\n",
      "somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\r\n",
      "room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\r\n",
      "to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\r\n",
      "himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\r\n",
      "close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\r\n",
      "project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\r\n",
      "often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\r\n",
      "to herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\r\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\r\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\r\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\r\n",
      "it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a\r\n",
      "manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\r\n",
      "hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\r\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\r\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\r\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\r\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\r\n",
      "languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\r\n",
      "speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\r\n",
      "sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\r\n",
      "politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\r\n",
      "nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\r\n",
      "rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\r\n",
      "silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\r\n",
      "much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,\r\n",
      "how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\r\n",
      "civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\r\n",
      "addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\r\n",
      "he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\r\n",
      "without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\r\n",
      "pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\r\n",

      "go the next day for a short time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\r\n",
      "settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\r\n",
      "see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\r\n",
      "months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\r\n",
      "with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\r\n",
      "man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\r\n",

      "“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse\r\n",

      "over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried\r\n",
      "to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided\r\n",
      "between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\r\n",
      "soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\r\n",
      "doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You\r\n",
      "would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\r\n",
      "unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\r\n",
      "mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\r\n",
      "of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\r\n",
      "dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\r\n",
      "soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\r\n",
      "future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\r\n",
      "subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\r\n",
      "marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\r\n",
      "of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\r\n",
      "with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\r\n",
      "use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\r\n",
      "he continued,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\r\n",
      "every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\r\n",
      "of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\r\n",
      "very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\r\n",
      "have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\r\n",
      "recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\r\n",
      "patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\r\n",
      "too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\r\n",
      "left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\r\n",
      "arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\r\n",
      "must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\r\n",
      "gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\r\n",
      "useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\r\n",
      "income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\r\n",
      "you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\r\n",
      "way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\r\n",
      "kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\r\n",
      "advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\r\n",
      "anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\r\n",
      "acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\r\n",
      "which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\r\n",
      "intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\r\n",
      "were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\r\n",
      "assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\r\n",
      "being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\r\n",
      "father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\r\n",
      "myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\r\n",
      "the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\r\n",
      "event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\r\n",
      "for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\r\n",
      "flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\r\n",
      "remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\r\n",
      "violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\r\n",
      "shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\r\n",
      "aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\r\n",
      "in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\r\n",
      "decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\r\n",
      "therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\r\n",
      "no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\r\n",
      "answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\r\n",
      "the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\r\n",
      "your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\r\n",
      "them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\r\n",
      "hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\r\n",
      "man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\r\n",
      "favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\r\n",
      "third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\r\n",
      "just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\r\n",
      "extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\r\n",
      "one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\r\n",
      "daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\r\n",
      "time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\r\n",
      "happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\r\n",
      "would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\r\n",
      "am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\r\n",
      "situation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\r\n",
      "very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\r\n",
      "disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\r\n",
      "seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\r\n",
      "economy, and other amiable qualifications.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\r\n",
      "give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\r\n",
      "believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\r\n",
      "refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\r\n",
      "In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\r\n",
      "feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\r\n",
      "estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\r\n",
      "considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\r\n",
      "spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\r\n",
      "addressed her,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\r\n",
      "shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\r\n",
      "me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\r\n",
      "know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\r\n",
      "first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\r\n",
      "encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\r\n",
      "female character.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\r\n",
      "exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\r\n",
      "of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\r\n",
      "may convince you of its being one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\r\n",
      "refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\r\n",
      "believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\r\n",
      "is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\r\n",
      "be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\r\n",
      "with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\r\n",
      "circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\r\n",
      "consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\r\n",
      "means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\r\n",
      "portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the\r\n",
      "effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\r\n",
      "therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\r\n",
      "shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\r\n",
      "suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\r\n",

      "     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\r\n",
      "     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\r\n",
      "     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\r\n",
      "     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\r\n",

      "herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,\r\n",
      "he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to\r\n",

      "was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give\r\n",

      "to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of\r\n",

      "good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say\r\n",
      "that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much\r\n",
      "delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but\r\n",
      "she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of\r\n",
      "the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were\r\n",
      "worn out, like his information.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early\r\n",
      "as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s\r\n",
      "door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when\r\n",
      "they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,\r\n",
      "looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and\r\n",
      "lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,\r\n",
      "whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to\r\n",
      "wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her\r\n",
      "for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and\r\n",
      "kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and\r\n",
      "shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her\r\n",
      "spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to\r\n",
      "hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\r\n",
      "particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and\r\n",
      "repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\r\n",

      "Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to\r\n",

      "led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of\r\n",
      "the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing\r\n",
      "at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the\r\n",
      "liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with\r\n",
      "coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw\r\n",
      "instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:\r\n",
      "his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\r\n",
      "minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her\r\n",
      "family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the\r\n",
      "neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\r\n",
      "in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\r\n",
      "formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s\r\n",
      "offers of refreshment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help\r\n",
      "fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,\r\n",
      "and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if\r\n",
      "wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though\r\n",
      "everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him\r\n",
      "by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,\r\n",
      "that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,\r\n",
      "which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on\r\n",
      "Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general\r\n",
      "Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire\r\n",
      "every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the\r\n",
      "fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had\r\n",
      "happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\r\n",
      "garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of\r\n",
      "which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most\r\n",
      "respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\r\n",
      "with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\r\n",
      "owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\r\n",
      "through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\r\n",
      "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\r\n",
      "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\r\n",
      "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\r\n",
      "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\r\n",
      "the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\r\n",
      "the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that\r\n",
      "bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a\r\n",
      "handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;\r\n",
      "but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white\r\n",
      "frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte\r\n",
      "took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,\r\n",
      "probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s\r\n",
      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\r\n",
      "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\r\n",
      "Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be\r\n",
      "forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by\r\n",
      "Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often\r\n",
      "forgotten.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It\r\n",
      "was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining\r\n",
      "in, observed,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine\r\n",
      "de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will\r\n",
      "be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I\r\n",
      "doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\r\n",
      "service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\r\n",
      "include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\r\n",
      "honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\r\n",
      "charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\r\n",
      "walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\r\n",
      "_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”\r\n",

      "The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\r\n",
      "telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\r\n",
      "Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\r\n",
      "and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\r\n",
      "was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\r\n",
      "pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\r\n",

      "so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which\r\n",
      "becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on\r\n",
      "whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion\r\n",

      "to his presentation at St. James’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile\r\n",
      "across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such\r\n",
      "raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but\r\n",
      "slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the\r\n",
      "house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally\r\n",
      "cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment\r\n",
      "increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or\r\n",
      "miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she\r\n",
      "thought she could witness without trepidation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a\r\n",
      "rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed\r\n",
      "the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,\r\n",
      "her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great\r\n",
      "condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it\r\n",
      "with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was\r\n",
      "performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks\r\n",
      "which he would have thought necessary.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely\r\n",
      "awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage\r\n",
      "enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;\r\n",
      "and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge\r\n",
      "of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself\r\n",
      "quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her\r\n",
      "composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked\r\n",
      "features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not\r\n",
      "conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her\r\n",
      "visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by\r\n",
      "silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as\r\n",
      "marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she\r\n",
      "believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment\r\n",
      "she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the\r\n",
      "daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her\r\n",
      "being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any\r\n",
      "likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her\r\n",
      "features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very\r\n",
      "little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance\r\n",
      "there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening\r\n",
      "to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before\r\n",
      "her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to\r\n",
      "admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,\r\n",
      "and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth\r\n",
      "looking at in the summer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,\r\n",
      "and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he\r\n",
      "had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by\r\n",
      "her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish\r\n",
      "nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;\r\n",
      "and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who\r\n",
      "was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a\r\n",
      "manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most\r\n",
      "gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty\r\n",
      "to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready\r\n",
      "to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between\r\n",
      "Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in\r\n",
      "listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all\r\n",
      "the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how\r\n",
      "little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and\r\n",
      "fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,\r\n",
      "and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be\r\n",
      "done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any\r\n",
      "intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every\r\n",
      "subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have\r\n",
      "her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic\r\n",
      "concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as\r\n",
      "to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be\r\n",
      "regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the\r\n",
      "care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was\r\n",
      "beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an\r\n",
      "occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with\r\n",
      "Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew\r\n",
      "the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,\r\n",
      "pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters\r\n",
      "she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of\r\n",
      "them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they\r\n",
      "had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her\r\n",
      "mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her\r\n",
      "questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then\r\n",
      "observed,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your\r\n",
      "sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no\r\n",
      "occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought\r\n",
      "necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our\r\n",
      "instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it\r\n",
      "some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One of them does.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss\r\n",
      "Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do\r\n",
      "you draw?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not at all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, none of you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother\r\n",
      "should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Has your governess left you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We never had any governess.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home\r\n",
      "without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must\r\n",
      "have been quite a slave to your education.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not\r\n",
      "been the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must\r\n",
      "have been neglected.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as\r\n",
      "wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to\r\n",
      "read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be\r\n",
      "idle certainly might.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had\r\n",
      "known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage\r\n",
      "one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady\r\n",
      "and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is\r\n",
      "wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that\r\n",
      "way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces\r\n",
      "of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and\r\n",
      "it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who\r\n",
      "was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite\r\n",
      "delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s\r\n",
      "calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your\r\n",
      "younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The\r\n",
      "younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must\r\n",
      "be very young?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much\r\n",
      "in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon\r\n",
      "younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and\r\n",
      "amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to\r\n",
      "marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth\r\n",
      "as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would\r\n",
      "not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly\r\n",
      "for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your\r\n",
      "Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;\r\n",
      "and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever\r\n",
      "dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not\r\n",
      "conceal your age.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not one-and-twenty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables\r\n",
      "were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat\r\n",
      "down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the\r\n",
      "two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her\r\n",
      "party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was\r\n",
      "uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson\r\n",
      "expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or\r\n",
      "having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the\r\n",
      "other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes\r\n",
      "of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins\r\n",
      "was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her\r\n",
      "for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.\r\n",
      "Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes\r\n",
      "and noble names.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,\r\n",
      "the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,\r\n",
      "gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered\r\n",
      "round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were\r\n",
      "to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the\r\n",
      "arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. As\r\n",
      "soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her\r\n",
      "cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which,\r\n",
      "for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But\r\n",
      "her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\r\n",

      "more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\r\n",
      "“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\r\n",
      "many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\r\n",

      "dependence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\r\n",

      "dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\r\n",
      "wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\r\n",
      "your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\r\n",

      "may like to have her own way.”\r\n",

      "in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\r\n",
      "give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\r\n",
      "got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\r\n",
      "say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\r\n",
      "very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\r\n",

      "in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\r\n",
      "to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\r\n",

      "would be an unpleasant thing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\r\n",
      "Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\r\n",
      "on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\r\n",
      "imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\r\n",
      "particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\r\n",
      "the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\r\n",
      "knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\r\n",
      "lady.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what arts did he use to separate them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\r\n",
      "only told me what I have now told you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\r\n",
      "indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\r\n",
      "was so thoughtful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\r\n",

      "judge?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\r\n",
      "friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\r\n",
      "determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\r\n",
      "she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\r\n",
      "particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\r\n",
      "that there was much affection in the case.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\r\n",
      "lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\r\n",
      "therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\r\n",
      "matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\r\n",
      "as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\r\n",
      "of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\r\n",
      "people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\r\n",
      "could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\r\n",
      "such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\r\n",
      "taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\r\n",
      "had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\r\n",
      "arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\r\n",
      "_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\r\n",
      "Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\r\n",
      "while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\r\n",
      "in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\r\n",
      "inflicted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\r\n",
      "Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\r\n",
      "having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\r\n",
      "business in London.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\r\n",
      "objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\r\n",
      "excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\r\n",
      "anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\r\n",
      "peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\r\n",
      "and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\r\n",
      "of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\r\n",
      "not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\r\n",
      "the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\r\n",
      "of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\r\n",
      "governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\r\n",
      "retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\r\n",
      "headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\r\n",
      "her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\r\n",
      "cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\r\n",

      "When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\r\n",
      "much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\r\n",
      "examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\r\n",
      "being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\r\n",
      "revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\r\n",
      "But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\r\n",
      "cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\r\n",
      "proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\r\n",
      "disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\r\n",
      "attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\r\n",
      "shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\r\n",
      "keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\r\n",
      "think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\r\n",
      "and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\r\n",
      "with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\r\n",
      "spirits, by all that affection could do.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\r\n",
      "cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\r\n",
      "that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\r\n",
      "mean to be unhappy about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\r\n",
      "door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\r\n",
      "being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\r\n",
      "the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\r\n",
      "this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\r\n",
      "affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\r\n",
      "room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\r\n",
      "health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\r\n",
      "She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\r\n",
      "then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\r\n",
      "said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\r\n",
      "in an agitated manner, and thus began:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\r\n",
      "repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\r\n",
      "doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\r\n",
      "and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\r\n",
      "followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\r\n",
      "heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\r\n",
      "tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\r\n",
      "degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\r\n",
      "to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\r\n",
      "consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\r\n",
      "suit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\r\n",
      "the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\r\n",
      "not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\r\n",
      "receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\r\n",
      "all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\r\n",
      "answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\r\n",
      "representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\r\n",
      "all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\r\n",
      "expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\r\n",
      "his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\r\n",
      "favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\r\n",
      "countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\r\n",
      "exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\r\n",
      "and she said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\r\n",
      "express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\r\n",
      "unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\r\n",
      "felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\r\n",
      "cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\r\n",
      "bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\r\n",
      "anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\r\n",
      "of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\r\n",
      "the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\r\n",
      "overcoming it after this explanation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\r\n",
      "on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\r\n",
      "surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\r\n",
      "his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\r\n",
      "appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\r\n",
      "himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\r\n",
      "dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\r\n",
      "might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\r\n",
      "civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\r\n",
      "of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\r\n",
      "against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\r\n",
      "Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\r\n",
      "other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\r\n",
      "against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\r\n",
      "favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\r\n",
      "the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\r\n",
      "happiness of a most beloved sister?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\r\n",
      "was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\r\n",
      "continued,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\r\n",
      "excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\r\n",
      "you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\r\n",
      "of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\r\n",
      "world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\r\n",
      "disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\r\n",
      "kind.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\r\n",
      "with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\r\n",
      "He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\r\n",
      "that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\r\n",
      "sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\r\n",
      "kinder than towards myself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\r\n",
      "but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\r\n",
      "is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\r\n",
      "decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\r\n",
      "many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\r\n",
      "say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\r\n",
      "or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\r\n",
      "in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\r\n",
      "interest in him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\r\n",
      "misfortunes have been great indeed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\r\n",
      "reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\r\n",
      "have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\r\n",
      "for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\r\n",
      "independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\r\n",
      "all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\r\n",
      "contempt and ridicule.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\r\n",
      "“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\r\n",
      "thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\r\n",
      "calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\r\n",
      "walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\r\n",
      "overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\r\n",
      "scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\r\n",
      "bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\r\n",
      "policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\r\n",
      "being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\r\n",
      "reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\r\n",
      "Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\r\n",
      "Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\r\n",
      "connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\r\n",
      "condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\r\n",
      "the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\r\n",
      "declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\r\n",
      "concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\r\n",
      "more gentlemanlike manner.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\r\n",
      "that would have tempted me to accept it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\r\n",
      "expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\r\n",
      "acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\r\n",
      "belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\r\n",
      "feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\r\n",
      "disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\r\n",
      "dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\r\n",
      "last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\r\n",
      "feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\r\n",
      "Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\r\n",
      "wishes for your health and happiness.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\r\n",
      "the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\r\n",
      "her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\r\n",
      "and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\r\n",
      "astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\r\n",
      "every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\r\n",
      "so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\r\n",
      "which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\r\n",
      "must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\r\n",
      "incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\r\n",
      "an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\r\n",
      "of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\r\n",
      "acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\r\n",
      "which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\r\n",
      "attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\r\n",
      "attachment had for a moment excited.\r\n",

      "She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\r\n",

      "which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\r\n",
      "surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\r\n",
      "else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\r\n",

      "directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\r\n",
      "sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\r\n",
      "she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\r\n",

      "look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\r\n",
      "made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\r\n",
      "verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\r\n",
      "walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\r\n",
      "which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\r\n",
      "now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\r\n",
      "pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\r\n",
      "though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\r\n",
      "towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\r\n",
      "a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\r\n",
      "composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\r\n",
      "meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\r\n",
      "then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\r\n",
      "out of sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\r\n",
      "Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\r\n",
      "perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\r\n",
      "quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\r\n",
      "full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\r\n",
      "from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\r\n",
      "its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\r\n",
      "offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\r\n",
      "intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\r\n",
      "which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\r\n",
      "effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\r\n",
      "should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\r\n",
      "and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\r\n",
      "your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\r\n",
      "demand it of your justice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\r\n",
      "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\r\n",
      "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\r\n",
      "from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\r\n",
      "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\r\n",
      "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\r\n",
      "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\r\n",
      "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\r\n",
      "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\r\n",
      "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\r\n",
      "persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\r\n",
      "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\r\n",
      "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\r\n",
      "to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\r\n",
      "their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\r\n",
      "to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\r\n",
      "offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\r\n",
      "be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\r\n",
      "Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\r\n",
      "preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\r\n",
      "it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\r\n",
      "apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\r\n",
      "in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\r\n",
      "you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\r\n",
      "information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\r\n",
      "a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\r\n",
      "event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\r\n",
      "observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\r\n",
      "that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\r\n",
      "in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\r\n",
      "cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\r\n",
      "regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\r\n",
      "though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\r\n",
      "them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\r\n",
      "here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\r\n",
      "sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\r\n",
      "by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\r\n",
      "unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\r\n",
      "your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\r\n",
      "acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\r\n",
      "was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\r\n",
      "her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\r\n",

      "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\r\n",
      "acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\r\n",
      "in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\r\n",

      "which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\r\n",

      "immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\r\n",

      "any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\r\n",
      "you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\r\n",
      "disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\r\n",
      "that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\r\n",
      "inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\r\n",
      "friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\r\n",
      "Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\r\n",
      "remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\r\n",
      "now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\r\n",
      "with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\r\n",
      "sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\r\n",
      "shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\r\n",
      "went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\r\n",
      "friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\r\n",
      "earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\r\n",
      "his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\r\n",
      "prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\r\n",
      "I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\r\n",
      "believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\r\n",
      "regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\r\n",
      "dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\r\n",
      "that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\r\n",
      "him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\r\n",
      "given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\r\n",
      "having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\r\n",
      "affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\r\n",
      "condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\r\n",
      "your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\r\n",
      "have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\r\n",
      "did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\r\n",
      "danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\r\n",
      "done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\r\n",
      "nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\r\n",
      "sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\r\n",
      "governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\r\n",
      "yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\r\n",
      "accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\r\n",
      "laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\r\n",
      "has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\r\n",
      "shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\r\n",
      "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\r\n",
      "the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\r\n",
      "the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\r\n",
      "to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\r\n",
      "therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\r\n",
      "afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\r\n",
      "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\r\n",
      "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\r\n",
      "young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\r\n",
      "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\r\n",
      "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\r\n",
      "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\r\n",
      "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\r\n",
      "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\r\n",
      "observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\r\n",
      "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\r\n",
      "only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\r\n",
      "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\r\n",
      "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\r\n",
      "died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\r\n",
      "last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\r\n",
      "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\r\n",
      "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\r\n",
      "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\r\n",
      "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\r\n",
      "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\r\n",
      "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\r\n",
      "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\r\n",
      "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\r\n",
      "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\r\n",
      "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\r\n",
      "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\r\n",
      "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\r\n",
      "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\r\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\r\n",
      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\r\n",
      "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\r\n",
      "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\r\n",
      "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\r\n",
      "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\r\n",
      "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\r\n",
      "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\r\n",
      "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\r\n",
      "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\r\n",
      "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\r\n",
      "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\r\n",
      "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\r\n",
      "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\r\n",
      "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\r\n",
      "and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\r\n",
      "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\r\n",
      "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\r\n",
      "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\r\n",
      "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\r\n",
      "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\r\n",
      "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\r\n",
      "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\r\n",
      "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\r\n",
      "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\r\n",
      "your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\r\n",
      "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\r\n",
      "myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\r\n",
      "establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\r\n",
      "the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\r\n",
      "Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\r\n",
      "acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\r\n",
      "most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\r\n",
      "recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\r\n",
      "strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\r\n",
      "persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\r\n",
      "was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\r\n",
      "imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\r\n",
      "herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\r\n",
      "elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\r\n",
      "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\r\n",
      "acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\r\n",
      "acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\r\n",
      "exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\r\n",
      "and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\r\n",
      "chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\r\n",
      "thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\r\n",
      "himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\r\n",
      "complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\r\n",
      "which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\r\n",
      "reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\r\n",
      "towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\r\n",
      "falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\r\n",
      "wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\r\n",
      "either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\r\n",
      "not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\r\n",
      "told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\r\n",
      "what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\r\n",
      "related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\r\n",
      "Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\r\n",
      "still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\r\n",

      "particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\r\n",
      "to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\r\n",

      "It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out\r\n",
      "together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;\r\n",
      "and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was\r\n",
      "to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s\r\n",
      "punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.\r\n",
      "These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed\r\n",
      "in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and\r\n",
      "dressing a salad and cucumber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set\r\n",
      "out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,\r\n",
      "“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the\r\n",
      "money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing\r\n",
      "her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it\r\n",
      "is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\r\n",
      "pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\r\n",
      "better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\r\n",
      "unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\r\n",
      "when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\r\n",
      "think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\r\n",
      "one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\r\n",
      "are going in a fortnight.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\r\n",
      "take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,\r\n",
      "and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to\r\n",
      "go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall\r\n",
      "have!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,\r\n",

      "a certain person that we all like.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he\r\n",
      "need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the\r\n",
      "waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse\r\n",
      "things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\r\n",
      "he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\r\n",
      "my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\r\n",
      "There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\r\n",

      "thing?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\r\n",
      "coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\r\n",
      "was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\r\n",
      "liberal!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\r\n",
      "ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\r\n",
      "boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and\r\n",
      "Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my\r\n",

      "let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\r\n",
      "home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\r\n",
      "since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\r\n",
      "flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\r\n",
      "before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\r\n",
      "She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\r\n",
      "being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\r\n",
      "get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\r\n",
      "Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\r\n",
      "how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\r\n",
      "_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\r\n",
      "of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend\r\n",
      "the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\r\n",
      "evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\r\n",
      "she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\r\n",
      "was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\r\n",
      "dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a\r\n",
      "lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\r\n",
      "Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\r\n",
      "one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\r\n",
      "and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\r\n",
      "did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\r\n",
      "Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\r\n",
      "something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\r\n",
      "assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\r\n",
      "companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\r\n",
      "could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\r\n",
      "in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\r\n",
      "say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\r\n",
      "came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\r\n",
      "which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\r\n",
      "table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\r\n",
      "was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\r\n",
      "fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\r\n",
      "retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\r\n",
      "rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various\r\n",
      "pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\r\n",
      "as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\r\n",
      "there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\r\n",
      "Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\r\n",
      "behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\r\n",
      "cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\r\n",
      "treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\r\n",
      "we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\r\n",
      "And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\r\n",
      "loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,\r\n",
      "to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\r\n",
      "generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\r\n",
      "_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\r\n",
      "anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\r\n",
      "Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\r\n",
      "the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\r\n",
      "home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\r\n",
      "another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\r\n",
      "again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\r\n",
      "_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond\r\n",
      "expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\r\n",
      "there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\r\n",
      "scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\r\n",
      "frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\r\n",
      "father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\r\n",
      "at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\r\n",
      "disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.\r\n",

      "in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\r\n",

      "She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\r\n",
      "as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\r\n",
      "who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\r\n",
      "so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\r\n",
      "collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though\r\n",
      "grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\r\n",
      "Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\r\n",
      "seek to clear one, without involving the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both\r\n",
      "of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\r\n",
      "with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\r\n",
      "enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\r\n",
      "about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy’s, but you shall do as you choose.”\r\n",

      "It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so\r\n",
      "very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\r\n",
      "only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\r\n",
      "with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\r\n",
      "thing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\r\n",
      "feel it so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\r\n",
      "of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\r\n",
      "every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\r\n",

      "make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\r\n",
      "relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\r\n",
      "myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\r\n",
      "might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\r\n",
      "lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\r\n",
      "relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister\r\n",
      "how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\r\n",

      "throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if\r\n",

      "folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a\r\n",
      "watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what\r\n",
      "has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked\r\n",
      "forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the\r\n",
      "satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to\r\n",
      "name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have\r\n",
      "some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by\r\n",
      "again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the\r\n",
      "present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes\r\n",
      "was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation\r\n",
      "for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother\r\n",
      "and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the\r\n",
      "scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.\r\n",
      "Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.\r\n",
      "But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my\r\n",
      "sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of\r\n",
      "pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can\r\n",
      "never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by\r\n",
      "the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely\r\n",
      "to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and\r\n",
      "always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that\r\n",
      "they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers\r\n",
      "had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as\r\n",
      "made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which\r\n",
      "she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a\r\n",
      "violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the\r\n",
      "camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less\r\n",
      "to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much\r\n",
      "too full of lines under the words to be made public.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,\r\n",
      "good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything\r\n",
      "wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter\r\n",
      "came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle\r\n",
      "of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton\r\n",
      "without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth\r\n",
      "hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably\r\n",
      "reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by\r\n",
      "some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment\r\n",
      "should be quartered in Meryton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast\r\n",
      "approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter\r\n",
      "arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and\r\n",
      "curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from\r\n",
      "setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again\r\n",
      "within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so\r\n",
      "far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with\r\n",
      "the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up\r\n",
      "the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the\r\n",
      "present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that\r\n",
      "county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three\r\n",
      "weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The\r\n",
      "town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where\r\n",
      "they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of\r\n",
      "her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,\r\n",
      "Dovedale, or the Peak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing\r\n",
      "the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it\r\n",
      "was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;\r\n",
      "and all was soon right again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was\r\n",
      "impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its\r\n",
      "owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,\r\n",
      "and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away\r\n",
      "before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at\r\n",
      "Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two\r\n",
      "younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin\r\n",
      "Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and\r\n",
      "sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every\r\n",
      "way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next\r\n",
      "morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One\r\n",
      "enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a\r\n",
      "suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear\r\n",
      "inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection\r\n",
      "and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were\r\n",
      "disappointments abroad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,\r\n",
      "nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither\r\n",
      "lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are\r\n",
      "sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present\r\n",
      "concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s\r\n",
      "former residence, and where she had lately learned that some\r\n",
      "acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen\r\n",
      "all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of\r\n",
      "Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It\r\n",
      "was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In\r\n",
      "talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an\r\n",
      "inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his\r\n",
      "willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so\r\n",
      "much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your\r\n",
      "acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at\r\n",
      "Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She\r\n",
      "must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,\r\n",
      "she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house\r\n",
      "richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the\r\n",
      "grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the\r\n",
      "country.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The\r\n",
      "possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly\r\n",
      "occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and\r\n",
      "thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such\r\n",
      "a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved\r\n",
      "that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the\r\n",
      "absence of the family were unfavourably answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid\r\n",
      "whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its\r\n",
      "proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for\r\n",
      "the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\r\n",
      "alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\r\n",
      "curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\r\n",
      "next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\r\n",
      "with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\r\n",
      "to the scheme.\r\n",

      "Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of\r\n",
      "Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned\r\n",
      "in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They\r\n",
      "entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through\r\n",
      "a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\r\n",
      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\r\n",
      "half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\r\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\r\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\r\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\r\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\r\n",
      "woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\r\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\r\n",
      "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\r\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\r\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\r\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\r\n",
      "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\r\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\r\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\r\n",
      "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\r\n",
      "hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\r\n",
      "wonder at her being where she was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\r\n",
      "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\r\n",
      "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\r\n",
      "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\r\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\r\n",
      "which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\r\n",
      "distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\r\n",
      "good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\r\n",
      "on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\r\n",
      "it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\r\n",
      "taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\r\n",
      "to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\r\n",
      "suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\r\n",
      "admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\r\n",
      "fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\r\n",
      "furniture of Rosings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With\r\n",
      "these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\r\n",
      "viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\r\n",
      "welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting\r\n",
      "herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\r\n",
      "me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\r\n",
      "absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\r\n",
      "asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\r\n",
      "replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\r\n",
      "party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\r\n",
      "not by any circumstance been delayed a day!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\r\n",
      "the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\r\n",
      "miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\r\n",
      "she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\r\n",
      "picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who\r\n",
      "had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the\r\n",
      "army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\r\n",
      "return it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\r\n",
      "“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\r\n",
      "other--about eight years ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,\r\n",
      "looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\r\n",
      "us whether it is like or not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\r\n",
      "intimation of her knowing her master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, very handsome.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\r\n",
      "will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\r\n",
      "master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\r\n",
      "be then. He was very fond of them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\r\n",
      "when she was only eight years old.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\r\n",
      "accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\r\n",
      "new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\r\n",
      "comes here to-morrow with him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\r\n",
      "communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\r\n",
      "from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\r\n",
      "master and his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\r\n",
      "time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\r\n",
      "good enough for him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is\r\n",
      "very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\r\n",
      "him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\r\n",
      "and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\r\n",
      "“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\r\n",
      "ever since he was four years old.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\r\n",
      "ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\r\n",
      "Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\r\n",
      "grateful to her uncle for saying,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\r\n",
      "having such a master.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\r\n",
      "meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\r\n",
      "good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\r\n",
      "was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\r\n",
      "world.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\r\n",
      "as affable to the poor.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\r\n",
      "Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\r\n",
      "of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\r\n",
      "furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\r\n",
      "prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\r\n",
      "master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\r\n",
      "many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever\r\n",
      "lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\r\n",
      "themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\r\n",
      "give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\r\n",
      "saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\r\n",
      "away like other young men.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not\r\n",
      "quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps we might be deceived.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\r\n",
      "sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\r\n",
      "the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\r\n",
      "give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\r\n",
      "last at Pemberley.\r\n",

      "Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter\r\n",
      "the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever\r\n",
      "can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\r\n",
      "is nothing he would not do for her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\r\n",
      "all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\r\n",
      "but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\r\n",
      "visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\r\n",
      "Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\r\n",
      "also more intelligible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\r\n",
      "little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\r\n",
      "of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\r\n",
      "arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\r\n",
      "such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\r\n",
      "when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\r\n",
      "earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\r\n",
      "gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\r\n",
      "father’s lifetime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle\r\n",
      "sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\r\n",
      "their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\r\n",
      "was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\r\n",
      "of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\r\n",
      "considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How\r\n",
      "much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\r\n",
      "or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\r\n",
      "the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\r\n",
      "the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\r\n",
      "herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\r\n",
      "than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\r\n",
      "its impropriety of expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\r\n",
      "they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\r\n",
      "consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\r\n",
      "to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\r\n",
      "conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\r\n",
      "suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\r\n",
      "appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\r\n",
      "instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\r\n",
      "blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\r\n",
      "surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\r\n",
      "and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\r\n",
      "of perfect civility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\r\n",
      "received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\r\n",
      "overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\r\n",
      "they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\r\n",
      "that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on\r\n",
      "beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\r\n",
      "aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\r\n",
      "scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\r\n",
      "returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\r\n",
      "alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\r\n",
      "uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\r\n",
      "impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\r\n",
      "minutes in which they continued together were some of the most\r\n",
      "uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\r\n",
      "spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\r\n",
      "inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\r\n",
      "in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\r\n",
      "distraction of his thoughts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\r\n",
      "moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\r\n",
      "leave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\r\n",
      "figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\r\n",
      "feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\r\n",
      "vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\r\n",
      "thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\r\n",
      "disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\r\n",
      "she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\r\n",
      "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\r\n",
      "only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\r\n",
      "discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\r\n",
      "moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\r\n",
      "again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\r\n",
      "strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\r\n",
      "her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\r\n",
      "family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\r\n",
      "never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\r\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\r\n",
      "he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\r\n",
      "account for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\r\n",
      "every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\r\n",
      "reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\r\n",
      "before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\r\n",
      "mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\r\n",
      "to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\r\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\r\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\r\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\r\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\r\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\r\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\r\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\r\n",
      "her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\r\n",
      "composure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\r\n",
      "roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\r\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\r\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\r\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\r\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\r\n",
      "expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\r\n",
      "beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\r\n",
      "miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\r\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\r\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\r\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\r\n",
      "the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\r\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\r\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\r\n",
      "it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\r\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\r\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\r\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\r\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\r\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\r\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\r\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\r\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\r\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\r\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\r\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\r\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\r\n",
      "met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\r\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\r\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\r\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\r\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\r\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\r\n",
      "he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\r\n",
      "she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\r\n",
      "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\r\n",
      "recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\r\n",
      "her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\r\n",
      "no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\r\n",
      "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\r\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\r\n",
      "she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\r\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\r\n",
      "revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\r\n",
      "she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\r\n",
      "fashion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\r\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\r\n",
      "it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\r\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\r\n",
      "connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\r\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\r\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\r\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\r\n",
      "relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\r\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\r\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\r\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\r\n",
      "chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\r\n",
      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\r\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\r\n",
      "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\r\n",
      "wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\r\n",
      "compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\r\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\r\n",
      "what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\r\n",
      "that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\r\n",
      "work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\r\n",
      "me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\r\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\r\n",
      "brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\r\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\r\n",
      "her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\r\n",
      "together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\r\n",
      "know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\r\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\r\n",
      "very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\r\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\r\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\r\n",
      "the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\r\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\r\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\r\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\r\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\r\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\r\n",
      "between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\r\n",
      "not very differently engaged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\r\n",
      "pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\r\n",
      "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\r\n",
      "during your stay at Lambton?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\r\n",
      "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\r\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\r\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\r\n",
      "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\r\n",
      "him think really ill of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\r\n",
      "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\r\n",
      "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\r\n",
      "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\r\n",
      "mile behind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\r\n",
      "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\r\n",
      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\r\n",
      "there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\r\n",
      "she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\r\n",
      "great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\r\n",
      "and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\r\n",
      "the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\r\n",
      "parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\r\n",
      "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\r\n",
      "walking slowly towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\r\n",
      "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her\r\n",
      "aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\r\n",
      "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\r\n",
      "_I_ have seen nothing of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\r\n",
      "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\r\n",
      "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\r\n",
      "or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\r\n",
      "perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\r\n",
      "disagreeable?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\r\n",
      "him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\r\n",
      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\r\n",
      "her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\r\n",
      "at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\r\n",
      "warn me off his grounds.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\r\n",
      "nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\r\n",
      "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\r\n",
      "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\r\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\r\n",
      "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\r\n",
      "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\r\n",
      "good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\r\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\r\n",
      "master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\r\n",
      "every virtue.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\r\n",
      "his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\r\n",
      "guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\r\n",
      "relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\r\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\r\n",
      "Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\r\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\r\n",
      "transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\r\n",
      "her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\r\n",
      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\r\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\r\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\r\n",
      "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\r\n",
      "no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\r\n",
      "acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\r\n",
      "intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\r\n",
      "much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\r\n",
      "but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above\r\n",

      "But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own\r\n",
      "arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the\r\n",
      "place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn\r\n",
      "to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a\r\n",
      "carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a\r\n",
      "curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the\r\n",
      "livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise\r\n",
      "to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she\r\n",
      "expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\r\n",
      "of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\r\n",
      "of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\r\n",
      "the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\r\n",
      "that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\r\n",
      "a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these\r\n",
      "newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed\r\n",
      "at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she\r\n",
      "dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in\r\n",
      "her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally\r\n",
      "suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked\r\n",
      "up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of\r\n",
      "inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\r\n",
      "took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new\r\n",
      "acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\r\n",
      "being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\r\n",
      "but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was\r\n",
      "only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\r\n",
      "her beyond a monosyllable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\r\n",
      "little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\r\n",
      "womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\r\n",
      "was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\r\n",
      "unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\r\n",
      "acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\r\n",
      "relieved by discerning such different feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was\r\n",
      "also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\r\n",
      "satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step\r\n",
      "was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still\r\n",
      "felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected\r\n",
      "cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He\r\n",
      "inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and\r\n",
      "looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\r\n",
      "than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\r\n",

      "arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\r\n",
      "each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from\r\n",
      "those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\r\n",
      "it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in\r\n",
      "doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\r\n",
      "evident enough.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\r\n",

      "in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long\r\n",
      "time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could\r\n",
      "reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the\r\n",

      "removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her\r\n",
      "that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,\r\n",

      "hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the\r\n",
      "company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations\r\n",
      "at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\r\n",

      "their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner\r\n",
      "at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a\r\n",
      "diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,\r\n",
      "readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing\r\n",
      "how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its\r\n",

      "that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than\r\n",
      "any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of\r\n",
      "society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for\r\n",
      "her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth\r\n",
      "again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to\r\n",
      "make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all\r\n",
      "this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and\r\n",
      "on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their\r\n",
      "visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some\r\n",
      "satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been\r\n",
      "little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her\r\n",
      "uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their\r\n",
      "favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was\r\n",
      "not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was\r\n",
      "much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\r\n",
      "it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\r\n",
      "interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\r\n",
      "as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\r\n",
      "not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character\r\n",
      "from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference\r\n",
      "to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known\r\n",
      "would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\r\n",
      "however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible\r\n",
      "that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four\r\n",
      "years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\r\n",
      "hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of\r\n",
      "their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had\r\n",
      "nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,\r\n",
      "it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town\r\n",
      "where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he\r\n",
      "was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\r\n",
      "there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the\r\n",
      "son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known\r\n",
      "fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\r\n",
      "him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\r\n",
      "the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\r\n",
      "long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\r\n",
      "she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\r\n",
      "certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\r\n",
      "had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\r\n",
      "that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\r\n",
      "valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\r\n",
      "time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\r\n",
      "into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\r\n",
      "favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\r\n",
      "which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\r\n",
      "there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\r\n",
      "overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\r\n",
      "loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\r\n",
      "petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\r\n",
      "unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\r\n",
      "persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\r\n",
      "accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\r\n",
      "without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\r\n",
      "where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\r\n",
      "opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\r\n",
      "a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\r\n",
      "gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\r\n",
      "such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\r\n",
      "means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\r\n",
      "she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\r\n",
      "welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\r\n",
      "depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\r\n",
      "that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\r\n",
      "possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\r\n",
      "such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very\r\n",
      "day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\r\n",
      "breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\r\n",
      "some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\r\n",
      "would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\r\n",
      "morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\r\n",

      "wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\r\n",
      "short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\r\n",
      "and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\r\n",
      "calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\r\n",

      "inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\r\n",
      "of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\r\n",
      "moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\r\n",
      "feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\r\n",
      "she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\r\n",
      "sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\r\n",
      "inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\r\n",
      "indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\r\n",
      "entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\r\n",
      "finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\r\n",
      "significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\r\n",
      "given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\r\n",
      "party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\r\n",
      "beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\r\n",
      "them round the table.\r\n",

      "feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\r\n",

      "regret that he came.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\r\n",
      "gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\r\n",
      "only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\r\n",
      "Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\r\n",
      "resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\r\n",
      "necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\r\n",
      "saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\r\n",
      "and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\r\n",
      "when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\r\n",
      "curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the\r\n",
      "smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\r\n",
      "objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\r\n",
      "to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s\r\n",
      "entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\r\n",
      "was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\r\n",
      "as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\r\n",
      "Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\r\n",
      "first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\r\n",
      "presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\r\n",
      "she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\r\n",
      "complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\r\n",
      "confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\r\n",
      "pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\r\n",
      "refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\r\n",

      "incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\r\n",
      "as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\r\n",
      "suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\r\n",
      "intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\r\n",
      "her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\r\n",
      "prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\r\n",
      "Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\r\n",
      "wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\r\n",
      "officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\r\n",
      "raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\r\n",
      "fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\r\n",
      "mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\r\n",
      "feel it!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\r\n",
      "share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\r\n",
      "family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\r\n",
      "requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\r\n",
      "could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost\r\n",
      "importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\r\n",
      "was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\r\n",
      "by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\r\n",
      "satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\r\n",
      "cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\r\n",
      "the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\r\n",
      "been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\r\n",
      "deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\r\n",
      "the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\r\n",
      "promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\r\n",
      "less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\r\n",
      "by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\r\n",
      "settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be\r\n",
      "done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was\r\n",
      "here when you sent for us;--was it so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\r\n",
      "_That_ is all settled.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\r\n",
      "prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\r\n",
      "truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\r\n",
      "hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\r\n",
      "to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\r\n",
      "impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\r\n",
      "business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\r\n",
      "be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\r\n",
      "sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\r\n",
      "Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\r\n",
      "remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\r\n",
      "the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\r\n",
      "have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.\r\n",

      "more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the\r\n",

      "friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s\r\n",
      "opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\r\n",
      "interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\r\n",
      "Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\r\n",
      "him capable of it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\r\n",
      "I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\r\n",

      "case?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof\r\n",
      "that they are not gone to Scotland.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\r\n",
      "presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\r\n",
      "Barnet road.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\r\n",
      "for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\r\n",
      "not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\r\n",
      "might strike them that they could be more economically, though less\r\n",
      "expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\r\n",
      "marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\r\n",
      "friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending\r\n",
      "to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\r\n",
      "cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\r\n",
      "beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\r\n",
      "forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\r\n",
      "restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\r\n",
      "dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\r\n",
      "nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\r\n",
      "other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\r\n",
      "brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s\r\n",
      "behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\r\n",
      "seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\r\n",
      "do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\r\n",
      "such a matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with\r\n",
      "tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such\r\n",
      "a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.\r\n",
      "Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never\r\n",
      "been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,\r\n",
      "nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement\r\n",
      "and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle\r\n",
      "and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.\r\n",
      "Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,\r\n",
      "flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing\r\n",
      "everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give\r\n",
      "greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which\r\n",
      "are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every\r\n",
      "charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of\r\n",
      "Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be\r\n",
      "their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,\r\n",
      "till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what\r\n",
      "Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every\r\n",
      "sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is\r\n",
      "as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity\r\n",
      "as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day\r\n",
      "of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at\r\n",
      "Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with\r\n",
      "such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other\r\n",
      "circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to\r\n",
      "relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From\r\n",
      "what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,\r\n",
      "reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He\r\n",
      "must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found\r\n",
      "her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you\r\n",
      "and Jane seem so well to understand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw\r\n",
      "so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was\r\n",
      "ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire\r\n",
      "was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the\r\n",
      "case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it\r\n",
      "necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it\r\n",
      "apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it\r\n",
      "was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of\r\n",
      "opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could\r\n",
      "be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a\r\n",
      "consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far\r\n",
      "enough from my thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I\r\n",
      "suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either\r\n",
      "side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware\r\n",
      "that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first\r\n",
      "he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all\r\n",
      "were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for\r\n",
      "the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular\r\n",
      "attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and\r\n",
      "wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,\r\n",
      "who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added\r\n",
      "to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by\r\n",
      "its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during\r\n",
      "the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.\r\n",
      "Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could\r\n",
      "find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on\r\n",
      "the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort\r\n",
      "to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long\r\n",
      "expectations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\r\n",
      "on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\r\n",
      "carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\r\n",
      "faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\r\n",
      "capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,\r\n",
      "hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from\r\n",
      "her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\r\n",
      "eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been\r\n",
      "heard of the fugitives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\r\n",
      "everything will be well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is my father in town?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And have you heard from him often?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\r\n",
      "that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\r\n",
      "particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\r\n",
      "again, till he had something of importance to mention.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\r\n",
      "shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\r\n",
      "all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\r\n",
      "Heaven! are quite well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you\r\n",
      "must have gone through!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their\r\n",
      "conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\r\n",
      "engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of\r\n",
      "the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\r\n",
      "thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\r\n",
      "had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\r\n",
      "found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\r\n",
      "however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\r\n",
      "deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\r\n",
      "every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\r\n",
      "to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’\r\n",
      "conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\r\n",
      "tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous\r\n",
      "conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;\r\n",
      "blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the\r\n",
      "errors of her daughter must be principally owing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton\r\n",
      "with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia\r\n",
      "had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\r\n",
      "of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\r\n",
      "side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\r\n",
      "been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\r\n",
      "the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\r\n",
      "child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\r\n",
      "Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\r\n",
      "to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\r\n",
      "in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\r\n",
      "we shall do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\r\n",
      "general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\r\n",
      "that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\r\n",
      "Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be\r\n",
      "prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\r\n",
      "It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\r\n",
      "may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\r\n",
      "and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\r\n",
      "lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\r\n",
      "come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\r\n",
      "together as to what is to be done.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I\r\n",
      "could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\r\n",
      "wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\r\n",
      "marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\r\n",
      "tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\r\n",
      "after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\r\n",
      "fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\r\n",
      "out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\r\n",
      "such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\r\n",
      "heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\r\n",
      "Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\r\n",
      "for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\r\n",
      "kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\r\n",
      "in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\r\n",
      "her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\r\n",
      "dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\r\n",
      "housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real\r\n",
      "occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to\r\n",
      "oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her\r\n",
      "tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it\r\n",
      "better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could\r\n",
      "most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the\r\n",
      "subject.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\r\n",
      "too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance\r\n",
      "before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The\r\n",
      "faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible\r\n",
      "in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger\r\n",
      "which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more\r\n",

      "must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have\r\n",

      "instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for\r\n",
      "the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived\r\n",
      "him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\r\n",

      "prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\r\n",
      "be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\r\n",
      "should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\r\n",
      "was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\r\n",
      "and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\r\n",
      "useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\r\n",
      "in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\r\n",
      "and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\r\n",
      "successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he\r\n",
      "would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\r\n",
      "late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\r\n",
      "husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\r\n",
      "income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\r\n",
      "the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\r\n",
      "latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\r\n",
      "regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\r\n",
      "could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\r\n",
      "terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\r\n",
      "expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\r\n",
      "approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\r\n",
      "engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\r\n",
      "that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\r\n",
      "done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\r\n",
      "arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\r\n",
      "hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\r\n",
      "allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\r\n",
      "through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within\r\n",
      "that sum.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was\r\n",
      "another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have\r\n",
      "as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports\r\n",
      "of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he\r\n",
      "naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon\r\n",
      "despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in\r\n",
      "its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was\r\n",

      "message to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate\r\n",
      "speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent\r\n",
      "philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of\r\n",
      "conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the\r\n",
      "happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant\r\n",
      "farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the\r\n",
      "good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from\r\n",
      "all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit\r\n",
      "in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery\r\n",
      "was considered certain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this\r\n",
      "happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in\r\n",
      "spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her\r\n",
      "triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\r\n",
      "her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\r\n",
      "accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\r\n",
      "attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\r\n",
      "servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a\r\n",
      "proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering\r\n",
      "what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and\r\n",
      "importance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the\r\n",
      "great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is\r\n",
      "too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for\r\n",
      "Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the\r\n",
      "servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and\r\n",
      "daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this\r\n",

      "imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it\r\n",
      "soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,\r\n",
      "that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his\r\n",
      "daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of\r\n",
      "affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend\r\n",
      "it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable\r\n",
      "resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her\r\n",
      "marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe\r\n",
      "possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new\r\n",
      "clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of\r\n",
      "shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they\r\n",
      "took place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of\r\n",
      "the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for\r\n",
      "her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper\r\n",
      "termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its\r\n",
      "unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the\r\n",
      "spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were\r\n",
      "few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\r\n",
      "but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s\r\n",
      "frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\r\n",
      "disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there\r\n",
      "seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been\r\n",
      "concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\r\n",
      "objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest\r\n",
      "kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\r\n",
      "wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\r\n",
      "feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\r\n",
      "blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\r\n",
      "hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\r\n",
      "longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\r\n",
      "seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\r\n",
      "she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they\r\n",
      "should meet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the\r\n",
      "proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now\r\n",
      "have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she\r\n",
      "doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,\r\n",
      "there must be a triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in\r\n",
      "disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and\r\n",
      "temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It\r\n",
      "was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease\r\n",
      "and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;\r\n",
      "and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must\r\n",
      "have received benefit of greater importance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what\r\n",
      "connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and\r\n",
      "precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their\r\n",
      "family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she\r\n",
      "could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to\r\n",
      "a couple who were only brought together because their passions were\r\n",
      "stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s\r\n",
      "acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to\r\n",
      "promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties\r\n",
      "that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal\r\n",
      "purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved\r\n",

      "considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his\r\n",
      "account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the\r\n",
      "Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are\r\n",
      "able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an\r\n",

      "an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He\r\n",
      "promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each\r\n",
      "have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have\r\n",
      "written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,\r\n",
      "and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham\r\n",
      "in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have\r\n",
      "pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying\r\n",
      "similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin\r\n",
      "a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I\r\n",
      "hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\r\n",
      "all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\r\n",
      "unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.\r\n",
      "Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she\r\n",

      "probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet\r\n",
      "them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival\r\n",

      "so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\r\n",

      "enough to provoke him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\r\n",
      "Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\r\n",
      "from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\r\n",
      "length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\r\n",
      "some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\r\n",

      "exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\r\n",
      "claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\r\n",
      "had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\r\n",
      "down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\r\n",
      "impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\r\n",
      "cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\r\n",
      "colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\r\n",
      "of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\r\n",
      "with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\r\n",
      "replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\r\n",
      "world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\r\n",
      "voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for\r\n",
      "the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:\r\n",
      "it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things\r\n",

      "Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked\r\n",

      "which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was\r\n",
      "afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,\r\n",
      "so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass\r\n",
      "next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the\r\n",
      "window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and\r\n",
      "smiled like anything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;\r\n",
      "and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\r\n",
      "the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\r\n",

      "their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by\r\n",
      "each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\r\n",

      "curious to hear how it was managed?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "said on the subject.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\r\n",
      "married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in\r\n",
      "that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\r\n",
      "o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\r\n",
      "were to meet us at the church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\r\n",
      "you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\r\n",
      "have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\r\n",
      "dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\r\n",
      "sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\r\n",
      "thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\r\n",
      "he would be married in his blue coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\r\n",
      "be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\r\n",
      "were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe\r\n",
      "me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\r\n",
      "fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\r\n",
      "rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\r\n",
      "called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\r\n",
      "know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\r\n",
      "frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\r\n",
      "and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\r\n",
      "luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set\r\n",
      "out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\r\n",
      "going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\r\n",
      "well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\r\n",
      "I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\r\n",
      "them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the\r\n",
      "subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will\r\n",
      "ask you no questions.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you\r\n",
      "all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\r\n",
      "power, by running away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\r\n",
      "was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\r\n",
      "sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\r\n",
      "where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\r\n",
      "Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\r\n",
      "brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\r\n",
      "placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\r\n",
      "could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\r\n",
      "wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\r\n",
      "Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\r\n",
      "intended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to\r\n",
      "know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\r\n",
      "speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\r\n",
      "a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\r\n",
      "for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\r\n",

      "     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\r\n",
      "     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\r\n",
      "     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\r\n",
      "     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\r\n",
      "     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\r\n",
      "     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\r\n",
      "     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\r\n",
      "     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\r\n",
      "     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\r\n",
      "     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\r\n",
      "     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\r\n",
      "     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\r\n",
      "     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\r\n",
      "     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\r\n",
      "     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\r\n",
      "     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\r\n",
      "     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\r\n",
      "     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\r\n",
      "     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\r\n",
      "     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\r\n",
      "     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\r\n",
      "     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\r\n",
      "     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\r\n",
      "     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\r\n",
      "     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\r\n",
      "     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\r\n",
      "     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\r\n",
      "     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\r\n",
      "     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\r\n",
      "     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\r\n",
      "     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\r\n",
      "     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\r\n",
      "     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\r\n",
      "     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\r\n",
      "     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\r\n",
      "     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\r\n",
      "     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\r\n",
      "     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\r\n",
      "     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\r\n",
      "     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\r\n",
      "     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\r\n",
      "     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\r\n",
      "     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\r\n",
      "     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\r\n",
      "     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\r\n",
      "     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\r\n",
      "     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\r\n",
      "     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\r\n",
      "     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\r\n",
      "     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\r\n",
      "     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\r\n",
      "     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\r\n",
      "     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\r\n",
      "     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\r\n",
      "     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\r\n",
      "     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\r\n",
      "     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\r\n",
      "     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\r\n",
      "     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\r\n",
      "     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\r\n",
      "     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\r\n",
      "     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\r\n",
      "     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\r\n",
      "     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\r\n",
      "     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\r\n",
      "     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\r\n",
      "     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\r\n",
      "     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\r\n",
      "     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\r\n",
      "     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\r\n",
      "     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\r\n",
      "     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\r\n",
      "     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\r\n",
      "     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\r\n",
      "     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\r\n",
      "     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\r\n",
      "     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\r\n",
      "     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\r\n",
      "     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\r\n",
      "     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\r\n",
      "     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\r\n",
      "     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\r\n",
      "     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\r\n",
      "     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\r\n",
      "     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\r\n",
      "     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\r\n",
      "     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\r\n",
      "     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\r\n",
      "     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\r\n",
      "     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\r\n",
      "     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\r\n",
      "     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\r\n",
      "     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\r\n",
      "     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\r\n",
      "     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\r\n",
      "     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\r\n",
      "     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\r\n",
      "     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\r\n",
      "     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\r\n",
      "     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\r\n",
      "     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\r\n",
      "     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\r\n",
      "     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\r\n",
      "     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\r\n",
      "     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\r\n",
      "     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\r\n",
      "     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\r\n",
      "     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\r\n",
      "     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\r\n",
      "     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\r\n",
      "     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\r\n",
      "     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\r\n",
      "     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\r\n",
      "     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\r\n",
      "     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\r\n",
      "     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\r\n",
      "     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\r\n",
      "     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\r\n",
      "     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\r\n",
      "     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\r\n",
      "     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\r\n",
      "     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\r\n",
      "     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\r\n",
      "     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He\r\n",
      "     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\r\n",
      "     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\r\n",
      "     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\r\n",
      "     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\r\n",
      "     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\r\n",

      "The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,\r\n",
      "in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the\r\n",
      "greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had\r\n",
      "produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her\r\n",
      "sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of\r\n",
      "goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be\r\n",
      "just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest\r\n",
      "extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken\r\n",
      "on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a\r\n",
      "research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he\r\n",
      "must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently\r\n",
      "meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always\r\n",
      "most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to\r\n",
      "pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard\r\n",
      "nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it\r\n",
      "was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt\r\n",
      "that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his\r\n",
      "affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to\r\n",
      "overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with\r\n",
      "Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from\r\n",
      "the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think\r\n",
      "how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no\r\n",
      "extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel\r\n",
      "he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising\r\n",
      "it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,\r\n",
      "she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might\r\n",
      "assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be\r\n",
      "materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that\r\n",
      "they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a\r\n",
      "return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to\r\n",
      "him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she\r\n",
      "had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards\r\n",

      "in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better\r\n",
      "of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and\r\n",
      "again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible\r\n",
      "of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly\r\n",
      "both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her\r\n",
      "master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several\r\n",

      "report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from\r\n",
      "any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that\r\n",
      "I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect\r\n",

      "to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\r\n",
      "there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come\r\n",
      "without it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "more unequal, than she had often seen them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\r\n",
      "about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\r\n",

      "will wait on him, of course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I\r\n",

      "nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will\r\n",

      "him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\r\n",
      "husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\r\n",
      "neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before\r\n",
      "_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It\r\n",
      "would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can\r\n",
      "hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\r\n",
      "but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it\r\n",
      "is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction\r\n",
      "of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have\r\n",
      "always so much.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,\r\n",
      "contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety\r\n",
      "and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days\r\n",
      "that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of\r\n",
      "seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in\r\n",
      "Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the\r\n",
      "paddock, and ride towards the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely\r\n",
      "kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\r\n",
      "to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\r\n",
      "again by her sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "him before. Mr. what’s his name--that tall, proud man.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of\r\n",
      "Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must\r\n",
      "say that I hate the very sight of him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\r\n",
      "of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\r\n",
      "which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\r\n",
      "after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\r\n",
      "enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\r\n",
      "mother talked on of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\r\n",
      "civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either\r\n",
      "of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be\r\n",
      "suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show Mrs.\r\n",
      "Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards\r\n",
      "him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,\r\n",
      "and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\r\n",
      "information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted\r\n",
      "for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\r\n",
      "interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\r\n",
      "what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\r\n",
      "coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\r\n",
      "was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\r\n",
      "behaviour in Derbyshire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "with herself for being so.\r\n",

      "know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\r\n",
      "his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\r\n",

      "the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\r\n",
      "before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\r\n",
      "country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\r\n",

      "will save all the best of the coveys for you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\r\n",
      "attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\r\n",
      "flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\r\n",
      "hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\r\n",
      "that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\r\n",
      "moments of such painful confusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be\r\n",

      "lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every\r\n",

      "as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as\r\n",
      "unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no\r\n",
      "difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded\r\n",
      "that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,\r\n",

      "own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\r\n",
      "consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\r\n",
      "gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\r\n",

      "could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\r\n",
      "such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\r\n",
      "advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\r\n",
      "she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\r\n",
      "cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness\r\n",
      "made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;\r\n",
      "and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\r\n",

      "uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\r\n",
      "came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\r\n",
      "would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you come to-morrow?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\r\n",
      "accepted with alacrity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\r\n",
      "dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters’ room, in her\r\n",
      "dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\r\n",
      "come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\r\n",
      "Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\r\n",
      "Lizzy’s hair.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is\r\n",
      "forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\r\n",
      "where is your sash, my dear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\r\n",
      "without one of her sisters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\r\n",
      "evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\r\n",
      "custom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\r\n",
      "five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\r\n",
      "Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\r\n",
      "impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\r\n",
      "Kitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter, mamma? What do\r\n",
      "you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still\r\n",
      "five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\r\n",
      "suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,” took her out of the room.\r\n",
      "Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\r\n",
      "premeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\r\n",
      "few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was forced to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,” said her mother as\r\n",
      "soon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\r\n",
      "my dressing-room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\r\n",
      "quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\r\n",
      "into the drawing-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\r\n",
      "everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\r\n",
      "daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\r\n",
      "addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\r\n",
      "officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\r\n",
      "forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\r\n",
      "daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\r\n",
      "an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s\r\n",
      "means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\r\n",
      "between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the\r\n",
      "happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\r\n",
      "persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s\r\n",
      "concurrence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\r\n",
      "morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\r\n",
      "agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\r\n",
      "or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into\r\n",
      "silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the\r\n",
      "other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\r\n",
      "and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get\r\n",
      "everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to\r\n",
      "write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for\r\n",
      "as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\r\n",
      "wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,\r\n",
      "she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her\r\n",
      "mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she\r\n",
      "perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as\r\n",
      "if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,\r\n",
      "the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each\r\n",
      "other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but\r\n",
      "_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by\r\n",
      "either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when\r\n",
      "Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,\r\n",
      "whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\r\n",
      "pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\r\n",
      "emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,\r\n",
      "why is not everybody as happy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\r\n",
      "delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\r\n",
      "kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\r\n",
      "allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\r\n",
      "said, for the present.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any\r\n",
      "account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it\r\n",
      "from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to\r\n",
      "know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\r\n",
      "family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\r\n",
      "card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\r\n",
      "with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\r\n",
      "previous months of suspense and vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious\r\n",
      "circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the\r\n",
      "happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\r\n",
      "father had been short and to the purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\r\n",
      "and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\r\n",
      "delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\r\n",
      "great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\r\n",
      "to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;\r\n",
      "and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\r\n",
      "expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\r\n",
      "basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\r\n",
      "Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\r\n",
      "Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\r\n",
      "made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\r\n",
      "her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\r\n",
      "speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\r\n",
      "though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\r\n",
      "Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\r\n",
      "how really happy he was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\r\n",
      "visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\r\n",
      "turned to his daughter and said,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\r\n",
      "goodness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in\r\n",
      "thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\r\n",
      "doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\r\n",
      "each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\r\n",
      "easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\r\n",
      "always exceed your income.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\r\n",
      "unpardonable in _me_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you\r\n",
      "talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\r\n",
      "more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\r\n",
      "happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\r\n",
      "would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\r\n",
      "be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\r\n",
      "he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\r\n",
      "that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\r\n",
      "ever was seen!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\r\n",
      "favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\r\n",
      "sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\r\n",
      "which she might in future be able to dispense.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\r\n",
      "begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\r\n",
      "coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\r\n",
      "supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\r\n",
      "detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\r\n",
      "himself obliged to accept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\r\n",
      "while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\r\n",
      "she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\r\n",
      "separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\r\n",
      "attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\r\n",
      "when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he\r\n",
      "was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\r\n",
      "it possible.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for\r\n",
      "it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to\r\n",
      "his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\r\n",
      "chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\r\n",
      "as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\r\n",
      "learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\r\n",
      "can never be what we once were to each other.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever\r\n",
      "heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\r\n",
      "the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\r\n",
      "really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\r\n",
      "would have prevented his coming down again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\r\n",
      "modesty.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\r\n",
      "the little value he put on his own good qualities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\r\n",
      "of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\r\n",
      "heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\r\n",
      "her against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried\r\n",
      "Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\r\n",
      "above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\r\n",
      "another man for you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\r\n",
      "Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\r\n",
      "happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\r\n",
      "good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\r\n",
      "secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been\r\n",
      "formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\r\n",
      "dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the\r\n",
      "sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\r\n",
      "lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the\r\n",
      "equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\r\n",
      "were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\r\n",
      "preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\r\n",
      "somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\r\n",
      "the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\r\n",
      "shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three\r\n",
      "continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\r\n",
      "open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their\r\n",
      "astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\r\n",
      "Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\r\n",
      "inferior to what Elizabeth felt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\r\n",
      "other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the\r\n",
      "head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\r\n",
      "name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of\r\n",
      "introduction had been made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\r\n",
      "high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\r\n",
      "for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\r\n",
      "mother?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\r\n",
      "“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\r\n",
      "and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\r\n",
      "who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a\r\n",
      "short silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\r\n",
      "assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\r\n",
      "summer: the windows are full west.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\r\n",
      "added,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\r\n",
      "Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\r\n",
      "letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\r\n",
      "refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\r\n",
      "declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\r\n",
      "on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\r\n",
      "will favour me with your company.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the\r\n",
      "different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,\r\n",
      "attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,\r\n",
      "Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\r\n",
      "drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be\r\n",
      "decent-looking rooms, walked on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a\r\n",
      "patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. And is\r\n",
      "_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any\r\n",
      "possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either\r\n",
      "would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\r\n",
      "resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\r\n",
      "_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw\r\n",
      "Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many\r\n",
      "hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it\r\n",
      "appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\r\n",
      "for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\r\n",
      "Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\r\n",
      "their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\r\n",
      "till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\r\n",
      "and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\r\n",
      "expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\r\n",
      "the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\r\n",
      "sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\r\n",
      "Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\r\n",
      "Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\r\n",
      "only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\r\n",
      "looked forward to as possible at some future time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help\r\n",
      "feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\r\n",
      "in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\r\n",
      "prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\r\n",
      "application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\r\n",
      "representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\r\n",
      "not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\r\n",
      "aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\r\n",
      "that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\r\n",
      "was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\r\n",
      "whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\r\n",
      "address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\r\n",
      "probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\r\n",
      "and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\r\n",
      "seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\r\n",
      "settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\r\n",
      "unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\r\n",
      "Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\r\n",
      "Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\r\n",

      "constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "sake of discovering them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\r\n",

      "very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\r\n",
      "so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\r\n",
      "her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\r\n",
      "happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\r\n",
      "felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\r\n",
      "warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\r\n",
      "been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\r\n",
      "expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\r\n",
      "though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\r\n",

      "every moment more valuable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\r\n",

      "soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\r\n",
      "to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\r\n",
      "London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\r\n",
      "substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\r\n",

      "peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\r\n",
      "such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\r\n",
      "her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of\r\n",
      "my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\r\n",
      "abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\r\n",
      "your relations.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\r\n",
      "to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\r\n",
      "unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\r\n",
      "evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly\r\n",

      "improved in civility.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\r\n",
      "it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\r\n",
      "reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a\r\n",
      "more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can\r\n",
      "scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\r\n",
      "confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\r\n",

      "a way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\r\n",
      "feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "contents?”\r\n",

      "her former prejudices had been removed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\r\n",
      "necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\r\n",
      "especially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\r\n",
      "of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\r\n",
      "make you hate me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\r\n",
      "preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\r\n",
      "opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\r\n",
      "changed as that implies.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly\r\n",
      "calm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\r\n",
      "dreadful bitterness of spirit.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\r\n",
      "adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\r\n",
      "of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\r\n",
      "different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\r\n",
      "attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\r\n",
      "philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\r\n",
      "pleasure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\r\n",
      "retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\r\n",
      "arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\r\n",
      "ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\r\n",
      "intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\r\n",
      "selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\r\n",
      "child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\r\n",
      "temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\r\n",
      "and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\r\n",
      "I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\r\n",
      "particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\r\n",
      "almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\r\n",
      "my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\r\n",
      "_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\r\n",
      "my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\r\n",
      "still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\r\n",
      "owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\r\n",
      "advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\r\n",
      "doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\r\n",
      "pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "wishing, expecting my addresses.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\r\n",
      "you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\r\n",
      "wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\r\n",
      "take a proper direction.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\r\n",
      "Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\r\n",
      "My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\r\n",
      "confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility\r\n",
      "in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\r\n",
      "to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\r\n",
      "see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\r\n",
      "introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\r\n",

      "He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her\r\n",
      "disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\r\n",
      "the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\r\n",
      "following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\r\n",
      "before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\r\n",
      "had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\r\n",
      "comprehend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a\r\n",
      "confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told\r\n",
      "him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his\r\n",
      "affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had\r\n",
      "the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself\r\n",
      "mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent\r\n",
      "to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was\r\n",

      "“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits\r\n",

      "coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or\r\n",

      "“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk\r\n",

      "never seen the view.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\r\n",
      "curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\r\n",
      "consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\r\n",
      "disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\r\n",
      "all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\r\n",
      "him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be\r\n",
      "asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\r\n",
      "application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother\r\n",
      "would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\r\n",
      "would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\r\n",
      "were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\r\n",
      "was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\r\n",
      "her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\r\n",
      "first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\r\n",
      "disapprobation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw\r\n",
      "Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was\r\n",
      "extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to\r\n",
      "be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\r\n",
      "his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\r\n",
      "filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\r\n",
      "reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\r\n",
      "looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\r\n",
      "he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\r\n",
      "pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he\r\n",
      "wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\r\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\r\n",
      "accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\r\n",
      "reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\r\n",
      "explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\r\n",
      "but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\r\n",
      "of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\r\n",
      "sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\r\n",
      "But will they make you happy?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my\r\n",
      "indifference?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\r\n",
      "this would be nothing if you really liked him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.\r\n",
      "Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\r\n",
      "know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\r\n",
      "such terms.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind\r\n",
      "of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\r\n",
      "condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\r\n",
      "having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\r\n",
      "disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\r\n",
      "respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\r\n",
      "up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\r\n",
      "greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\r\n",
      "discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\r\n",
      "_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\r\n",
      "about.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\r\n",
      "and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\r\n",
      "object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\r\n",
      "estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\r\n",
      "his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\r\n",
      "months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\r\n",
      "she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the\r\n",
      "match.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to\r\n",
      "say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\r\n",
      "you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\r\n",
      "had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\r\n",
      "made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him\r\n",
      "his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\r\n",
      "and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have\r\n",
      "paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\r\n",
      "way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\r\n",
      "his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\r\n",
      "Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\r\n",
      "at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come\r\n",
      "for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after\r\n",
      "half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join\r\n",
      "the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for\r\n",
      "gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer\r\n",
      "anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\r\n",
      "would come in time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\r\n",
      "and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;\r\n",
      "for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to\r\n",
      "utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could\r\n",
      "comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what\r\n",
      "was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a\r\n",
      "lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\r\n",
      "her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\r\n",
      "have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\r\n",
      "and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\r\n",
      "you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\r\n",
      "pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\r\n",
      "dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\r\n",
      "hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\r\n",

      "Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\r\n",
      "soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\r\n",
      "her mother followed her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’\r\n",
      "consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\r\n",
      "passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\r\n",
      "in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\r\n",

      "their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\r\n",

       " 'Turning from Bessie (though her presence was far less obnoxious to me\\r\\nthan that of Abbot, for instance, would have been), I scrutinised the\\r\\nface of the gentleman: I knew him; it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary,\\r\\nsometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for\\r\\nherself and the children she employed a physician.',\n",

       " '“This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable\\r\\nlady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own\\r\\ndaughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid\\r\\nby an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent\\r\\npatroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful\\r\\nlest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent\\r\\nher here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to\\r\\nthe troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of\\r\\nyou not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button\\r\\nof his surtout, muttered something to his family, who rose, bowed to\\r\\nMiss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the\\r\\nroom.',\n",

       " 'This world is pleasant—it would be dreary to be called from it, and to\\r\\nhave to go who knows where?”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had\\r\\nbeen infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time\\r\\nit recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each\\r\\nside, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the\\r\\none point where it stood—the present; all the rest was formless cloud\\r\\nand vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and\\r\\nplunging amid that chaos.',\n",

       " '“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\\r\\n“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\\r\\neyes.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A\\r\\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\\r\\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled.',\n",
       " 'But with such\\r\\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\\r\\nchance of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\\r\\nMeryton?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.',\n",

       " 'On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\\r\\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\\r\\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\\r\\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\\r\\nbelow, with a book.',\n",

       " 'I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\\r\\nthat noble place.',\n",

       " 'There is not a\\r\\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\\r\\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\\r\\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\\r\\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\\r\\nsister, to observe the game.',\n",
       " '“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will\\r\\nshe be as tall as I am?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think she will.',\n",

       " 'The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\\r\\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\\r\\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general.',\n",
       " 'I\\r\\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\\r\\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.',\n",
       " '“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your\\r\\nidea of an accomplished woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really\\r\\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\\r\\nwith.',\n",
       " 'A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\\r\\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\\r\\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\\r\\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\\r\\nwill be but half deserved.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add\\r\\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\\r\\nreading.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.',\n",
       " 'I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\\r\\nthis?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“_I_ never saw such a woman.',\n",
       " '_I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\\r\\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.”\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\\r\\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\\r\\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\\r\\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward.',\n",

       " 'When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.\\r\\nCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much\\r\\nstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he\\r\\nmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour\\r\\nat Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much\\r\\ngratification; but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings\\r\\nwas, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the\\r\\ndescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found\\r\\nthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all\\r\\nthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison\\r\\nwith the housekeeper’s room.',\n",
       " 'In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,\\r\\nwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the\\r\\nimprovements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the\\r\\ngentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Philips a very attentive\\r\\nlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she\\r\\nheard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as\\r\\nsoon as she could.',\n",
       " 'To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,\\r\\nand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine\\r\\ntheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the\\r\\ninterval of waiting appeared very long.',\n",
       " 'It was over at last, however.',\n",

       " 'The\\r\\nofficers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,\\r\\ngentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but\\r\\nMr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and\\r\\nwalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips,\\r\\nbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.',\n",

       " 'With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\\r\\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\\r\\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\\r\\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\\r\\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.',\n",
       " 'When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\\r\\nin return, by sitting down to whist.',\n",
       " '“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad to\\r\\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----” Mrs. Philips was very\\r\\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.',\n",

       " 'At first there\\r\\nseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\\r\\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\\r\\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\\r\\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.',\n",
       " 'Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\\r\\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\\r\\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\\r\\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy.',\n",
       " 'She dared not even\\r\\nmention that gentleman.',\n",

       " 'A clear ten\\r\\nthousand per annum.',\n",

       " '“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\\r\\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\\r\\nyesterday.',\n",
       " 'Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly.',\n",
       " '“I have spent\\r\\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\\r\\ndisagreeable.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being\\r\\nagreeable or otherwise.',\n",

       " 'The\\r\\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\\r\\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an\\r\\nill-tempered man.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWickham only shook his head.',\n",
       " '“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is\\r\\nlikely to be in this country much longer.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I\\r\\nwas at Netherfield.',\n",
       " 'I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\\r\\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy.',\n",
       " 'If _he_\\r\\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go.',\n",
       " 'We are not on friendly terms,\\r\\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\\r\\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\\r\\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.',\n",
       " 'His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\\r\\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\\r\\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\\r\\nthousand tender recollections.',\n",
       " 'His behaviour to myself has been\\r\\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\\r\\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\\r\\nmemory of his father.”\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\\r\\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.',\n",
       " 'Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\\r\\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\\r\\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\\r\\nvery intelligible gallantry.',\n",
       " '“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,\\r\\n“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire.',\n",
       " 'I know it to be a\\r\\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\\r\\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\\r\\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.',\n",

       " 'A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\\r\\nnow made it eligible.',\n",
       " 'The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\\r\\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\\r\\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\\r\\nwere speaking of just now.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Indeed!”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\\r\\nliving in his gift.',\n",

       " 'I cannot do justice to his kindness.',\n",

       " 'How could his\\r\\nwill be disregarded?',\n",
       " 'Why did not you seek legal redress?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\\r\\ngive me no hope from law.',\n",
       " 'A man of honour could not have doubted the\\r\\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\\r\\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\\r\\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.',\n",
       " 'Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\\r\\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\\r\\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\\r\\nanything to deserve to lose it.',\n",
       " 'I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\\r\\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\\r\\nfreely.',\n",

       " 'But the fact is, that we are very\\r\\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is quite shocking!',\n",

       " 'Till I\\r\\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\\r\\never as he expressed them.',\n",
       " '“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive?',\n",
       " 'what can\\r\\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\\r\\nattribute in some measure to jealousy.',\n",
       " 'Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\\r\\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon\\r\\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life.',\n",
       " 'He had\\r\\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\\r\\nof preference which was often given me.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\\r\\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\\r\\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\\r\\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as\\r\\nthis!”\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_\\r\\nremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of\\r\\nhis resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper.',\n",
       " 'His disposition\\r\\nmust be dreadful.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can\\r\\nhardly be just to him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To\\r\\ntreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his\\r\\nfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very\\r\\ncountenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself\\r\\nwith--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from\\r\\nchildhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest\\r\\nmanner.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest\\r\\npart of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,\\r\\nsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.',\n",
       " '_My_\\r\\nfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,\\r\\nappears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use\\r\\nto the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the\\r\\nPemberley property.',\n",
       " 'He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\\r\\nintimate, confidential friend.',\n",

       " '“How abominable!',\n",
       " 'I wonder that the very\\r\\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you.',\n",
       " 'If from no better\\r\\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\\r\\ndishonesty I must call it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be\\r\\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend.',\n",
       " 'It has\\r\\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling.',\n",
       " 'But we are none\\r\\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\\r\\nimpulses even than pride.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\\r\\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\\r\\npoor.',\n",
       " 'Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\\r\\nfather was, have done this.',\n",
       " 'Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\\r\\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\\r\\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive.',\n",
       " 'He has also _brotherly_ pride,\\r\\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\\r\\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\\r\\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe shook his head.',\n",
       " '“I wish I could call her amiable.',\n",
       " 'It gives me pain to\\r\\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\\r\\nproud.',\n",

       " 'How can Mr. Bingley,\\r\\nwho seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,\\r\\nbe in friendship with such a man?',\n",
